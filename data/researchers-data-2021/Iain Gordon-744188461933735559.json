This has reduced biodiversity and compromised many important ecological processes. What is the best way to re-build depauperate mammal communities with multi-species reintroductions? What effects do multi-species reintroductions have on recipient ecosystems? This project will explore these questions by reintroducing three mammal species to a critically endangered temperate woodland: a carnivore (the eastern quoll), an insectivore (yellow-footed antechinus), and a herbivore (the eastern chestnut mouse). Results from this sequenced multi-species reintroduction experiment will have broad applicability to ecosystem restoration in Australia and overseas.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP140100209", "id": "618574", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100209", "researchers": ["A/Prof Adrian Manning", "Prof Iain Gordon", "Dr Sue McIntyre", "Dr Saul Cunningham", "Dr Philip Barton", "Dr Samuel Banks", "Dr Donald Fletcher", "Dr Murray Evans", "Mr Stuart Jeffress"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 557981, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100209", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100209", "LP140100209"], "subjects": ["ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT", "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES", "ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION; SPECIES REINTRODUCTION; SPECIES REINTRODUCTION; TEMPERATE WOODLANDS; TEMPERATE WOODLANDS; TEMPERATE WOODLANDS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618574"}]}]}
