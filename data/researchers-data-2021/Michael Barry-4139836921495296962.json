Australian enterprises. Topics only lightly covered in previous research get in-depth analysis: the cooperative versus adversarial climate in workplaces; the type and intensity of workplace problems experienced by managers and employees; the effect of deteriorated relations and problems on organisational performance; and assessments of managers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; strengths and shortcomings. Similar surveys are done for the USA to benchmark Australian experience and derive comparative lessons. Numerous measures for improvement in practice and policy are identified.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140100194", "id": "518143", "institutions": ["Griffith University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100194", "researchers": ["Prof Adrian Wilkinson", "A/Prof Michael Barry", "Prof Bruce Kaufman", "A/Prof Rafael Gomez"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 255566, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:52:01Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:07:22Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Griffith University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100194", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100194", "DP140100194"], "subjects": ["BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT", "COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES", "industrial relations"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518143"}]}]}
