Conroy\u2019s project focused on high resolution mapping of the site using professional drone equipment, resulting in a range of 3D photogrammetry models covering key areas of the site and finds. Rowan also shoots footage of the process of excavation from an artistic perspective, revealing unique and often overlooked aspects of the aesthetics of the methods of field archaeology. Using drone technology and high-end digital imaging platforms, Conroy\u2019s research explores new ways of seeing and perspectives enabled by emerging technologies and software. This research was the subject of the major exhibition\u00a0Sightseeing\u00a0at the Goulburn Regional Art Gallery (Jul-Sep 2019).Conroy's work focuses on the use of large format photography to document ancient and modern, rural and urban architecture and detritus as a means to reflect upon the archaeology of the present. He combines the use of traditional large format view cameras with the latest digital technology to produce photographic prints of great detail and clarity. Conroy has combined his interest in archaeology and the visual arts through archaeological illustration and photography, which has been made possible through twenty years of involvement on excavations in Greece and Cyprus, and research journeys in Lebanon, Syria and Turkey.\u00a0The major focus of Conroy's practice continues to be the melding between the disciplines of art and archaeology and is clearly reflected in his role as Associate Director, Artistic\u00a0Interpretation at the Paphos Theatre Archaeological Excavations in Cyprus.Theoretical and critical enquiry key areas of interestThe drone in artistic practiceContemporary photographic practicePhotographic archives, museum archives\u00a0Landscape studies, photography, and the environment\u00a0Rephotography: Landscape and site photographyArchaeology and the visual arts:\u00a0Photography as archaeologyArchaeologies of the contemporary past and the archaeology of the presentContemporary ruins, ruin thought, the ruin in photographyThe photobook and artist\u2019s booksMaterials and technology key areas of interestInkjet printing: alternative processes and ink sets, fine art applicationsThe print and the future of still photography: digital and analogue print objects in the age of the retina displayAlternative and hacked printing technologies for artistic outputHigh resolution imagingUnmanned Aerial Vehicles\u00a0as an area of artistic research3D photogrammetry in the visual arts, heritage, museums and archaeology"], "biography": "Rowan Conroy holds a PhD (2012) and a BVA (Hons I) (2004) from Sydney College of the Arts, the University of Sydney.
