Whilst currently used opioid drugs are effective in acute pain, they are either ineffective in chronic pain or have considerable side effects. In this project we will develop a new class of analgesics that have a different mechanism of action to traditional analgesics. It is hoped that these new drugs will provide long term pain relief without debilitating side effects.", "title": "Glycine Transport Inhibitors for the Treatment of Pain", "id": "1348609", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1144429", "researchers": ["Dr Tristan Rawling", "Prof MacDonald Christie", "Prof Michael Murray", "Prof Renae Ryan", "Prof Robert Vandenberg", "Dr Megan O'Mara"], "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 923660, "fundingScheme": "Project Grants", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": null, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T04:23:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-03T01:50:06Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Robert Vandenberg"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1144429", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1144429", "GNT1144429"], "subjects": ["Basic Science", "pain mechanisms | membrane protein | glycine | transporters | lipid biochemistry"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1348609"}]}]}
