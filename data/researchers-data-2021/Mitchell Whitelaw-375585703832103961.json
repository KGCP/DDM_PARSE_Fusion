I work with partners and collaborators on applied, practice-led research with public outcomes. My theoretical work draws on and contextualises this practice, as well as investigating emerging concepts and forms in digital art and design. Current themes in my research are:Design for Digital Heritage and HumanitiesThe digitisation of cultural heritage is creating vast masses of valuable content, but traditional search-based interfaces do a poor job of representing this richness. Working with institutional partners, academic collaborators and students, I develop \u201cgenerous interfaces\u201d, working with cultural data to create inviting, explorable websites for cultural collections. I also develop speculative and poetic applications for digital heritage, reimagining and reanimating these archives for a contemporary context. Since 2010 this work has been funded by partners including the Asia Art Archive, Canberra Museum and Gallery, the State Library of Queensland, the State Library of New South Wales, the National Archives of Australia, and the National Gallery of Australia.Data Aesthetics and Generative SystemsAs designers and artists take up digital processes, they adapt and reconfigure data and computing for their own ends, generating new creative forms as well as questioning conventional notions of authorship, aesthetics, agency, and the work. This theme spans practical and theoretical investigations of digital art and design.Digital MaterialityThough it sometimes pretends otherwise, digital culture is never immaterial. It occupies and transforms the material world, and art and design play a critical role in imagining and experimenting with the dialog between data and matter. From experimental fabrication to tangible data visualisation and speculative computing, this theme investigates digital materiality through practice-led, critical and theoretical projects."], "biography": "", "project": ["", "", "Funded Research Projects", "\"Visualising a Bibliography of Indian Art.\" Contracted research for Asia Art Archive, 2015.

Whilst aviation has transformed Australian society over the last hundred years, its heritage is under-appreciated and at risk. The project will build a partnership between the aviation industry, community groups, museums and a multidisciplinary academic team to develop fresh insights from under-utilised sources of aviation heritage, communicate their unique stories to the public through innovative exhibitions and publications, and help conserve it for future generations. As a result, the project will make an important contribution to culture and society by enabling community access to neglected and at-risk sources of aviation heritage, and engage the public&rsquo;s fascination with aviation through new interpretations of its extraordinary social and cultural impact.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP160101232", "id": "1317847", "institutions": ["University of Canberra"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160101232", "researchers": ["A/Prof Tracy Ireland", "Prof Ross Gibson", "A/Prof Tim Sherratt", "Prof Ross Harley", "A/Prof Anne Clarke", "Dr Peter Hobbins", "Dr Mitchell Whitelaw", "Dr Jane Ferguson", "Dr Prudence Black", "Prof Paul Ashton", "Dr Brett Holman", "Miss Jennifer Wilson", "Dr Claire Marrison"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 440000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:53Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Canberra"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160101232", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160101232", "LP160101232"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1317847"}]}]}
