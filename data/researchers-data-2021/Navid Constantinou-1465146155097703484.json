He is a physicist at heart and he\u2019s fascinated with geophysical fluid dynamics. His Ph.D. research focussed on atmospheric dynamics and in particular the study of how the sub polar jet stream interacts with atmospheric turbulence. After his PhD, he was awarded a NOAA Climate & Global Change postdoctoral fellowship (2015-2017) to go at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego. There, tried to shed insight on some of the physical processes that occur in the ocean by studying the interaction among oceanic eddies, large-scale ocean currents, and underwater mountains at the bottom of the ocean. He joined ANU as part of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes in May 2018. He is part of the climate variability project focussing on the circulation of the Southern Ocean. Besides research he enjoys biking a lot and whenever he has the chance he enters in the ocean in person.", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "eddy saturation in a barotropic model", "year": 2017, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "navid constantinou"}]}, {"title": "a statistical state dynamics based theory for jet wave coexistence in beta plane turbulence", "year": 2017, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "navid constantinou"}]}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
