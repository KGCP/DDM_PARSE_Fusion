She is Chair of Retina Australia\u2019s Grants Assessment Committee, and member of the Scientific Advisory of the Ophthalmic Research Institute of Australia. Jan commenced her research career as Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Sydney Department of Clinical Ophthalmology in 1980, studying development of the human retina. Between 1988 and 2003 she was a lecturer, senior lecturer and Associate Professor in Anatomy at the University of Sydney, while maintaining an honorary position in the Department of Clinical Ophthalmology studying development and aging of the primate retina. Jan moved to the ANU in 2004, and since that time has focused on identification of the genes that regulate development of human central retina, and the factors that destabilize central retina and promote AMD. Jan\u2019s work provides a broad perspective on how the macular / foveal part of the primate retina has evolved, how it develops, the molecular factors involved, the functional constraints, and why the macula is vulnerable to degeneration. She has co-edited a major text on Macular Degeneration, participates in a number of national and international collaborations, and most recently was part of an international team that identified the cellular mechanism causing death of retinal pigment epithelial cells in the dry form of AMD.", "project": ["1.

[{"description": "The fovea is a specialized part of the retina which enables us to see fine detail. The fovea is characterised by an extremely high concentration of photoreceptor cells in a small, prescribed area to detect detail in the pattern of light reaching the retina. Each of these photoreceptor cells is connected to at least four other cells within the retina, which further refine the information coded by the photoreceptors. Because this circuitry involves so many cells, the retina has a tendency to be thick at the specialized area. However, in development the cells connected to the foveal photoreceptors move away from the central concentration of photoreceptors, still keeping their contacts with them. This results in thinning of the retina locally, so it has a volcanoe-like formation at the fovea, in which photoreceptors are concentrated within the crater and the displaced cells are accumulated on the rim. The events which trigger these cell displacements that form the fovea are unknown. We propose to investigate growth factors which signal between the fovea and the developing blood supply, and the relationship between the formation of the fovea and neuronal activity. This study will provide a new perspective on factors which affect central visual function and its vulnerability to insult in premature infants and in aging.", "title": "Development of the Primate Fovea", "id": "82485", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/153825", "researchers": ["Prof Jan Provis", "A/Pr Michele Madigan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 196527.55, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:18Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:40Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Jan Provis"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/153825", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/153825", "153825"], "subjects": ["321016", "fovea centralis", "prematurity", "primate", "retinal development", "vascular development", "Macular disease", "Retinopathy of Prematurity", "Visual Impairment"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82485"}]}, {"description": "We believe that breakdown of the barrier that separates the delicate nervous tissue of the eye from the bloodstream, the blood-retinal barrier, may be an early event in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), now overall the commonest cause of blindness in Australia. We have recently demonstrated with the first scientific clinical trials to be conducted in the world that an injection of steroid into the jelly of the eye, or vitreous , of the steroid triamcinolone slows the growth of abnormal blood vessels in patients with wet AMD. In the current project, Prof Nick King, a cell biologist and viral immunologist, will collaborate with Dr Michelle Madigan, A-Prof Jan Provis, both experts in experimetnal AMD, and A-Prof Mark Gillies, a clinician-scientist specialising in AMD, to study how the treatment works using established animal and laboratory models of a damaged blood retinal barrier. We will be particularly interested in processes which are thought to critical in the development these diseases. We will also study newly described processes by which the junctions that seal the cells of the barrier together come apart. We will be interested not just in the cells that make the barrier, but also the effect of nearby cells that are thought to contribute to it. These studies will provide a solid foundation for the rationalisation of steroid treatment for AMD which can be expected to result in improved outcomes for our patients. The studies may also provide insights into how other barriers malfunction, such as the blood brain barrier which breaks down in Alzheimer s disease and multiple sclerosis.", "title": "The Blood-Retinal Barrier - Modelling Mechanisms for Maintenance, Breakdown and Repair", "id": "96926", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/464828", "researchers": ["Prof Mark Gillies", "Prof Jan Provis", "A/Pr Michele Madigan", "Prof Nicholas King"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 394310.06, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-17T04:48:32Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:44:42Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Nicholas King"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/464828", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/464828", "464828"], "subjects": ["321016", "Blood-retinal barrier", "Choroidal endothelium", "Flavivirus", "Macular degeneration", "Pigment epithelium", "Age-related macular degeneration", "Virus infection", "Virus infections", "Vision disorders - blindness"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96926"}]}, {"description": "Age-related macular degeneration, involves the progressive loss of light sensitive cells from the retina, and is a major cause of loss of vision, and quality of life, in people over 60.
