This includes engineering of new and improved enzyme activities using renewable substrates (e.g. CO2, ammonia), optimisation of cofactor-dependent biotransformations, and development of new tools for control of multi-enzymatic reactions in vitro (cell-free metabolic engineering)\u00a0and in whole-cell. Bioproducts targeted range from platform chemicals and fuels to green fertilisers to fine chemicals and biologics (therapeutics).", "", "\"Just-add-water\" nucleic acid amplification", "The use of Synthetic Biology to assemble biological components into customised useful devices is now a reality. We are employing these principles for the delivery of bio-devices that carry out pathogen nucleic acid amplification and formulating these into stable \"just-add-water\" formats to produce novel user-friendly, low-cost diagnostic kits that may be applied within primary laboratory settings and at point-of-care. We aim to deliver real-world solutions that may be utilised in low-tech settings in the developing world and remote Australia.", "", "DNA biosensors", "DNA-based biotechnologies are rapidly forming a new landscape in the world of technology and innovation. However accurate identification of a specific DNA-sequence (e.g. as produced through nucleic acid amplification) still requires high-end equipment and complex protocols. Together with colleagues at the CSIRO (Health & Biosecurity) we are harnessing the power of biological recognition for the production of new biosensors that are able to rapidly identify specific ds-DNA sequences. These allow accurate detection/quantitation of a target DNA sequence and are amenable to application with low-cost analytical technologies in primary laboratories and at point-of-care.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "One-Pot Multienzymatic Transformation of NH3 , CO2 , and Ornithine into the Organic Nitrogen Plant Fertilizer Citrulline Using a Single Recombinant Lysate of E. coli", "year": "2019", "source": "ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, vol. 7, no. 9, pp. 8522-8529", "authors": ["Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos", "Hartley C", "French N"]}, {"title": "Recombinant cell-lysate-catalysed synthesis of uridine-5", "year": "2019", "source": "-triphosphate from nucleobase and riboseand without addition of ATP', New Biotechnology, vol. 49, pp. 104-111", "authors": ["Loan T", "Easton C", "Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos"]}, {"title": "Hyperthermophilic Carbamate Kinase Stability and Anabolic In Vitro Activity at Alkaline pH", "year": "2018", "source": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology, vol. 84, no. 3, pp. 1-13", "authors": ["Hennessy J", "Latter M", "Philbrook A", "Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos"]}, {"title": "TP Recycling with Cell Lysate for Enzyme-Catalyzed Chemical Synthesis, Protein Expression and PCR", "year": "2016", "source": "ACS Chemical Biology, vol. 11, no. 12, pp. 3289-3293", "authors": ["Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos", "Caron K", "Loan T"]}, {"title": "Biocatalysis for the application of CO2 as a chemical feedstock", "year": "2015", "source": "Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 11, pp. 2370-2387", "authors": ["Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos", "Easton C"]}, {"title": "Formate production through carbon dioxide hydrogenation with recombinant whole cell biocatalysts", "year": "2014", "source": "Bioresource Technology, vol. 164, pp. 7-11", "authors": ["Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos", "Kim H", "Easton C"]}, {"title": "Clostridium carboxidivorans strain P7T recombinant formate dehydrogenase catalyzes reduction of CO2 to formate", "year": "2013", "source": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology, vol. 79, no. 2, pp. 741-744", "authors": ["Apostolos (Lee) Alissandratos", "Kim H", "Matthews H"]}, {"title": "Biochemical processes for generating fuels and commodity chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass", "year": "2013", "source": "in M.
