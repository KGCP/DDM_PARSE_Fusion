Much of my research examines the history of gender and sexuality, including a new collaborative project on photography and film in early 20th-century sex research.My new monograph Sex between Body and Mind: Psychoanalysis and Sexology in the German-speaking World, 1890s-1930s\u00a0(University of Michigan Press, 2019) is a cultural history of sexuality and medical-scientific sex research examining debates around the sexual life of the child, the nature of shellshock, the origins of homosexuality, trans identity, and the role of the sex hormones. This is the first book to closely examine vital encounters among this era\u2019s German-speaking researchers across their emerging professional and disciplinary boundaries.\u00a0https://www.press.umich.edu/9861753/sex_between_body_and_mindMy first book, The Masculine Woman in Weimar Germany (Berghahn Books, 2011) explored the widely-discussed 'masculinization of woman' in 1920s German popular culture, in areas such as fashion, sport, literature, cinema, and magazines produced by newly emerging sexual minorities. It traces the connotations and controversies surrounding this figure  from her rise to media prominence in the early 1920s until the beginning  of the Nazi period.
