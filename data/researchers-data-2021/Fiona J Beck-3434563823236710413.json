She joined the Research School of Engineering at The Australian National University as a research fellow and lecturer in 2015. She spent the previous 4 years as a Marie Curie Research Fellow at ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, employing plasmonics to enhance the performance of novel optoelectronic devices. She obtained a PhD from The ANU in 2011, with a thesis on designing plasmonic light trapping schemes for applications in solar cells. She has an MSci degree in Physics from The University of Glasgow, and was awarded the Eve and Ravenscroft prize for the most distinguished graduate from the Faculty of Physical Sciences.", "project": [""], "publication": [{"title": "Towards emissions certification systems for international trade in hydrogen: the policy challenge of defining boundaries for emissions accounting", "year": "2020", "source": "Energy, vol. 215, no.
