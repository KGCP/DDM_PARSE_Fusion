At present, is contributing to the Deep Human Past project, seeking to tell the \u2018deep\u2019 history of Australia and expand notions of history and the past. She is also working on a book about the Tiwi Islands and Aboriginal encounters with Catholicism as well as researching the closing of Christian missions, secularisation and Indigenous self-determination. She is co-editor of the Journal of Religious History and associate monographs editor for Aboriginal history Monographs.", "project": ["This project will analyse Australia's epic Indigenous narratives alongside relevant new scientific evidence in order to create a big picture history of Greater Australia/Sahul, and as a result transform the scale and scope of history. Fresh periodisations and understandings will reorient this history in its wider global context. Through critiquing the evolution of disciplines, especially the world history/prehistory divide and the Cambridge training nexus, the project will develop future-oriented transdisciplinary techniques for researching the deep human past. As part of the project, a diverse generation of early career scholars will join top international networks and be trained in digital research techniques and delivery platforms for researching this exceptional human history.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "n emerging Protestant doctrine of self-determination in the Northern Territory", "year": "2020", "source": "in Laura Rademaker & Tim Rowse (ed.), Indigenous Self-Determination in Australia: Histories and Historiography, ANU Press, Canberra, Australia, pp. 59-81", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "Going Off Script: Aboriginal Rejection and Repurposing of English Literacies", "year": "2020", "source": "in Tony Ballantine, Lachy Paterson & Angela Wanhalla (ed.), Indigenous Textual Cultures Reading and Writing in the Age of Global Empire, Duke University Press, Durham & London, pp. 195-216", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "How shall we write the history of self-determination in Australia?", "year": "2020", "source": "in Laura Rademaker & Tim Rowse (ed.), Indigenous Self-Determination in Australia: Histories and Historiography, ANU Press, Canberra, Australia, pp. 1-39", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker", "Rowse T"]}, {"title": "Indigenous Self-Determination in Australia: Histories and Historiography", "year": "2020", "source": "ANU PressCanberra, Australia", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker", "Rowse T", "eds"]}, {"title": "The Polygamy Question: Missions, Marriage, and Assimilation", "year": "2019", "source": "Journal of Religious History, vol. 43, no. 2, pp. 251-268", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "Found in Translation: Many Meanings on a North Australian Mission", "year": "2018", "source": "University of Hawaii PressUnited States", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "White grief, happy friendship: Jane Goodale and emotional anthropological research", "year": "2019", "source": "History and Anthropology, vol. 30, no. 3, pp. 313pp-330pp", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "Going Native: Converting Narratives in Tiwi Histories of Twentieth-Century Missions", "year": "2018", "source": "Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 70, 1 (2018): 98-118", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "The Importance of Marrying \"Straight\": Aboriginal Marriage and Mission Monogamy in Twentieth-century North Australia", "year": "2017", "source": "Gender and History, vol. 29, no. 3, pp. 641-657pp", "authors": ["Laura Rademaker"]}, {"title": "Gender, Race and Twentieth-Century Dissenting Traditions", "year": "2018", "source": "in Mark P.
