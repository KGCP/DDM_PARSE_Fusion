It aims to move beyond the standard Marxist account of the arts commissioned by the King as a means to instantiate absolutist ideology to present a study of the intellectual culture that inspired a vast program of images and objects that take the King\u2019s history as their subject, positing the future historian as their intended audience.", "Travelling objects: Art and cultural diplomacy\u00a0\u00a0(Ongoing): The study of prints and medals\u00a0commissioned to commemorate history, art and science during the reign of Louis XIV (1638-1715), offer an intriguing opportunity to reassess the cultural (and cross-cultural) value of the prints and medals in the early-modern period. Louis XIV's prints and medals were distributed across the known world, throughout Europe and the East, to King Phra Narai of Siam (1633-1688), the Safavid Shah, Sultan Hussein of Persia (1668-1726), and the Chinese Kangxi Emperor (1654-1722). Mapping patterns of non-colonial cultural exchange between France, Britain, China and Persia during this period, this study will present a revised account of visual culture at the Sun King\u2019s court to define its place within a global history of art.", "Louis after Louis: Appropriations and reinventions of the Louis XIV style from the 18th to the 21st century\u00a0(Ongoing): Louis XIV is the paradigmatic monarch of the early-modern period. During his reign he was emulated by friends and enemies alike, who appropriated (and parodied) all aspects of the visual and material culture of his reign. This longue dur\u00e9e project explores the appropriations and transformations of the Sun King's image from the John Churchill, the First Duke of Marlborough in the early-eighteenth century to Ludwig II of Bavaria in the late nineteenth century.", "Performing Transdisciplinarity:\u00a0This Australian Research Council Discovery Project is a cross-institutional collaboration between ANU Glenn Roe and Robert Wellington), The University of Melbourne (Erin Helyard), The University of Sydney (Mark Ledbury), and Oxford University (Nicholas Cronk). It is the first study to specifically address the unique transdisciplinary nature of eighteenth-century print culture, the quintessential example of which is the illustrated songbook. In order to recreate the inherent performativity of these complex cultural objects, new models of cross-disciplinary collaboration and multimedia dissemination are required. This project provides one such model of methodological innovation: the team will explore the nexus of image, music, and text in an exemplary French songbook, reconceived as a multimedia digital interface for sharing and linking deep disciplinary knowledge and for the innovative recreation of the sounds, sensibilities, and social mores of late-eighteenth-century France."], "publication": [{"title": "Metadata, Material Culture, and Global Art History", "year": "2020", "source": "in K Browne (ed.), The Routledge Companion to Digital Humanities and Art History, Routledge, United Kingdom, pp. 326-337", "authors": ["Robert Wellington"]}, {"title": "ntiquarianism and the Visual Histories of Louis XIV: Artifacts for a Future Past", "year": "2015", "source": "Ashgate Publishing CompanyFarnham and Burlington VT", "authors": ["Robert Wellington"]}, {"title": "Lines of Sight: Isra\u00ebl Silvestre and the axial symbolism of Louis XIV", "year": "2016", "source": "s gardens at Versailles'Studies in the History of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, November, 2016", "authors": ["Robert Wellington"]}, {"title": "M\u00e9dailles en mouvement: la r\u00e9ception des m\u00e9dailles de Louis XIV \u00e0 la crois\u00e9e des cultures", "year": "2016", "source": "in Yvan Loskutoff (ed.), Le M\u00e9dailles de Louis XIV et Leur Livre, Presses Universitaires de Rouen and Le Havre, 201", "authors": ["Robert Wellington"]}, {"title": "Louis XIV", "year": "2015", "source": "s Medal Cabinet at Versailles'The Medal, vol. 67, pp. 12-25", "authors": ["Robert Wellington"]}, {"title": "Nouvelles pr\u00e9cisions sur les estampes dessin\u00e9es par Van der Meulen et ses peintures \u00e0 Marly", "year": "2014", "source": "trans.
