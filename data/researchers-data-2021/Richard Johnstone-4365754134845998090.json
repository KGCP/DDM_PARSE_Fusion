His current research includes Australian Research Council-funded projects on compliance with OHS, anti-discrimination and dismissal law; and (with Michael Quinlan) on the implementation of OHS process standards in four Australian jurisdictions: Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. He is also examining the regulation of OHS in non-employment relationships, including work on road freight, contractors and sub-contractors, labour hire, and franchise arrangements. With Neil Gunningham, Richard has conducted major policy studies for the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, the Department of Minerals and Energy, New South Wales and the WorkCover Authority of Ne w South Wales. The WorkCover Authority of New South Wales study was further developed, and was published as Regulating Workplace Safety: Systems and Sanctions, in the Oxford Socio-Legal Studies Series in 1999. Richard has also published a leading general text, Occupational Health and Safety Law and Policy (Thompson Law Book, 1997 and 2nd ed 2004).He has also published five books and a dozen articles or chapters on various aspects of law teaching.
