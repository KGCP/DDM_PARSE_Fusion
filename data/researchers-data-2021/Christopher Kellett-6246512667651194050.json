A general approach of feedback design based on so-called Lyapunov methods has been available for many years. However, this approach has suffered from several drawbacks including the inability to account for constrained system actions (eg&nbsp;where certain system variables must remain within certain constraints) and the inability to specify desired system performance. This project intends to leverage recent developments in Lyapunov methods, including novel numerical techniques, to develop a high-performance feedback control methodology for nonlinear dynamical systems competitive with the best currently available techniques.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160102138", "id": "664010", "institutions": ["University of Newcastle"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102138", "researchers": ["A/Prof Christopher Kellett", "Prof Dr Lars Gruene", "A/Prof Sigurdur Hafstein"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 440786, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Newcastle"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102138", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102138", "DP160102138"], "subjects": ["APPLIED MATHEMATICS", "MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664010"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to redevelop the most commonly used social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) modeling framework using the best available scientific data and state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification techniques, providing government and industry decision-makers with a robust tool to tackle a carbon-constrained future.
