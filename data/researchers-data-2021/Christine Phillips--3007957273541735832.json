Australian general practice will therefore have a critical role to play in control efforts during an influenza pandemic, and also in sustaining other primary health care activities. After an initial surge in attendances, there may be a decline in attendance, as Australians become more reluctant to congregate in a place where they may become ill. This study seeks to complement the Australian Pandemic Influenza Management Plan by developing a range of action plans for use by general practitioners and public health authorities to support essential primary health care functions through a pandemic, and maximize general practice's contribution to control efforts. A range of methods will be used, including systematic review of existing literature, economic modeling of the Medicare costs and savings of different models of health care, interviews with key informants who have helped develop disaster response plans for general practice, or who are in positions of leadership. The project will culminate in the development of a simulation exercise to be used as a self-assessment tool for general practitioners, and a summit of general practice stakeholders who will help to finalise agreed action plans for the general practice response to pandemic influenza.", "title": "Strenthening the contribution of Australian general practice to the control of pandemic influenza", "id": "95025", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410228", "researchers": ["Prof Nicholas Glasgow", "A/Pr Christine Phillips", "A/Pr Paul Dugdale", "Dr Mohamed Patel", "Prof Marjan Kljakovic"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 110257, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:28Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Marjan Kljakovic"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410228", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410228", "410228"], "subjects": ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Community Health", "General practice", "Keywords", "Public health policy"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95025"}]}]}
