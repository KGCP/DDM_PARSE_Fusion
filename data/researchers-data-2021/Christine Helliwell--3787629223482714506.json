This project (ongoing since 1985) explores the utility of the core concepts used within social, and especially anthropological, theory (\"nature\", \"society\", \"social structure\", \"autonomy\", \"equality\", \"public/private\" and so on) for describing and analysing Borneo societies and, by extension, non-Western societies more broadly. In particular, my concern is with the embeddedness of such concepts in Western forms of subjectivity and sociality, and with their consequent inapplicability to Borneo (and other) contexts.", "2) Experiences and representations of World War II among Borneo Dayak peoples. This pan-Borneo project, begun in 2014, is being carried out in partnership with the Australian War Memorial (AWM).\u00a0 It is particularly concerned with Dayak memories and contemporary representations of both Australian and Japanese soldiers and prisoners of war. It is funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant and will culminate in an exhibition at the AWM in 2017/2018.", "3) The concepts and theorisation of \"society\" and \"culture\" as these are used in a range of social science and humanities disciplines. This project is particularly interested in the relationship between these concepts and Western forms of subjectivity and government (including self-government). My most recent work in this area, conducted in collaboration with Professor Barry Hindess, has explored the history of the concept of 'society' within the social sciences, focusing particularly on its role in the colonial government of - and attempts to impose new forms of subjectivity on - subject peoples. Funded by two Australian Research Council Large Research Grants, 1997-9 and 2001-04.", "4) The cultural constitution of gender/sex. This project (ongoing since the early 1990s) focuses on the ways in which gender is constituted in different  societies, and how this relates to the forms of subjectivity and  sociality found there. As part of this project I have examined the  cross-cultural utility of notions such as \"domesticity\",  \"public/private\" and so on, as well as exploring more strictly feminist  debates concerning the concepts of \"male\" and \"female\" themselves.", "4) Marriage, relationship and the concept of 'love' among Westerners. This project stems from M.A. fieldwork carried out among Pakeha New Zealanders in 1979-81, and conducted sporadically among Anglo-Australians and New Zealanders since. It focuses especially on how Western conceptions of relationship - including love and marriage - relate to specific forms of subjectivity and government."], "publication": [{"title": "The Great Map of Mankind", "year": "2016", "source": "in Tugba Basaran, Didier Bigo, Emmanuel-Pierre Guittet; RBJ Walker (ed.), International Political Sociology - Transversal Lines, Routledge, London New York, pp. 145-161", "authors": ["Christine Helliwell", "Hindess B"]}, {"title": "Kantian cosmopolitanism and its limits", "year": "2015", "source": "Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 26-39", "authors": ["Christine Helliwell", "Hindess B"]}, {"title": "The Japanese Malay: ethnic categorisation in southwest Borneo", "year": "2014", "source": "Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde (Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia and Oceania), vol. 170, pp. 191-214", "authors": ["Christine Helliwell"]}, {"title": "Time and the others", "year": "2013", "source": "in Sanjay Seth  (ed.), Postcolonial Theory and International Relations: A Critical Introduction, Routledge, Abingdon, Oxon UK, pp. 70-83", "authors": ["Christine Helliwell"]}, {"title": "ncestorship without (human) ancestors: ritual hearths and hierarchy in Gerai", "year": "2012", "source": "in Pascal Couderc and Kenneth Sillander (eds.), Ancestors in Borneo Societies.
