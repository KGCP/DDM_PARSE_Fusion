After 3 years as a field forester, I moved to Sydney where I eventually became the Senior Inventory Officer responsible for quantifying the growth and value of plantations and native forests of NSW. In 1994, I returned to the ANU to teach and research into forest measurement and management. Since then, my most significant research contributions have been the development of optimal sampling strategies, modelling tools, and decision-support systems for trees and associated biota at stand, landscape and continental scales. This research integrates my knowledge of and innovation in applied statistics (for sampling), data acquisition (from remotely sensed imagery and ground-based surveys), modelling (of tree and stand dynamics), and expert and decision support systems (as integrating methods). This research has broad application in both natural, plantation and urban environments, and is novel in its integration of quantitative and qualitative information; it has significant national and international standing as a result. This research has been influential in development of the National Carbon Accounting System for Australia (winner of the Eureka Environmental Science Award), and in catalysing the development and adoption of new approaches by forest and land managers and policy makers. Work has supported research grants, consultancies or other income in excess of $2 million (including Greenhouse Action Strategic R&D project initiatives; climate change and plantation management for FWPRDC; various ACIAR projects to improve PNG human resources and education systems and inventory and information systems, and a city-wide census of urban public-land trees and the development of a decision support system). In 2009, I took leave to become the inaugural Chair and Professor of Forestry at the Waiariki Institute (Rotorua, New Zealand) and subsequently became the Director of Research with a mandate to increase the research profile and potential of that Institute (in fields from primary industry, Maori development, nursing and health studies, computing and business). After a successful 3 years, I returned to the ANU to take up my teaching and research roles in the Fenner School of Environment and Society.", "project": ["Understanding the Carbon and Pollution Mitigation Potential of Australia's Urban Forest.", "Developing Sampling and Measurement Guidelines for determining carbon in forests and woodlands.", "Understanding Uncertainty and Risk in Forest Carbon (and other) estimates.", "Improved Teaching and Learning for Higher Degree (Research) students.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Physical and Non-Physical Benefits of Vertical Greenery Systems: A Review", "year": "2019", "source": "Journal of Urban Technology, vol. 26, no. 4, pp. 53-78", "authors": ["Ghazalli A", "Cristopher Brack"]}, {"title": "lterations in use of space, air quality, temperature and humidity by the presence of vertical greenery system in a building corridor", "year": "2018", "source": "Urban Forestry & Urban Greening, vol. 32, pp. 177-184pp", "authors": ["Ghazalli A", "Cristopher Brack", "Bai X"]}, {"title": "Strategic forest planning and operational decisions under uncertainty", "year": "2017", "source": "Australian Forestry, vol. 80, no. 2, pp. 69-77", "authors": ["Cristopher Brack", "McLarin M"]}, {"title": "Effect of species grouping and site variables on aboveground biomass models for lowland tropical forests of the Indo-Malay region", "year": "2017", "source": "Annals of Forest Science, vol. 74, no. 1, pp. 1-14pp", "authors": ["Solichin S", "Cristopher Brack", "Rusolono T"]}, {"title": "Monaro dieback: simple answers are too simple", "year": "2017", "source": "Australian Forestry, vol. 80, no. 2, pp. 113-114pp", "authors": ["Ross C", "Cristopher Brack"]}, {"title": "dvanced Land Cover Mapping of Tropical Peat Swamp Forest using Discrete Return Lidar", "year": "2017", "source": "Geoplanning: Journal of Geomatics and Planning, vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 1-8pp", "authors": ["Solichin S", "Andersen H", "Cristopher Brack"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2017", "source": "Forestry Education at ANU.

including temperature regulation and rainfall capture. But measuring these benefits is currently prohibitively costly and inaccurate. This project will solve this by developing a new model of urban forest ecosystem services that uses remotely sensed three dimensional data to map canopy cover. Models using this data, which is being collected by an increasing number of governments, represents a novel advance on the established methodology that requires expensive and time-consuming fieldwork. The advancements made in this research will mean that environmental planners will be able to better plan the urban forest so that cities are more liveable and resilient in the face of climate change.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150103135", "id": "618065", "institutions": ["RMIT University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150103135", "researchers": ["A/Prof Marco Amati", "Dr Stephen Livesley", "A/Prof Cristopher Brack"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 274326, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:04Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["RMIT University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150103135", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150103135", "DP150103135"], "subjects": ["URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING", "BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND DESIGN", "RAINFALL INTERCEPTION; URBAN FORESTRY; URBAN HEAT ISLAND"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618065"}]}]}
