Mathematical topics which arise include operator algebras, subfactors, geometric field theories, quantum algebra and tensor categories, vertex operator algebras, and complex function theory. I am particularly interested in analytic questions arising out of the interactions between these mathematical fields which are facilitated by QFT.More information is available at http://math.tener.cc."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "on classification of vertex operator algebras by their representation categories", "year": 2016, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "james tener"}]}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
