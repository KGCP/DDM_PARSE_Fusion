My field research in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, examines how nocturnal lemurs perceive their predators. Using the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus) as a basal primate model, I conduct field and laboratory experiments to assess how predation avoidance may have affected the selection for cognitive abilities, and possibly neocortex enlargement, in the primate lineage. In my experiments I expose wild-caught mouse lemurs to models, odors, and sounds of their natural and alien avian, mammalian, and snake predators. Measuring\u00a0 behavioral responses allows me to assess how mouse lemurs perceive and interpret particular characteristics of those stimuli, such as shape or color, as well as the relevance of the different sensory modes in predator recognition. I am also planning on testing how age affects memory in mouse lemurs, as they are the only non-human primates known to develop Alzheimer\u2019s Disease \u2013like symptoms in the brain. I am further interested in how memory and experience affects perception, health and attitude in humans."], "biography": "", "project": ["I am planning a new zoo project where I will be examining the utility of sensory stimuli in the enrichment of captive primates and other animals.
