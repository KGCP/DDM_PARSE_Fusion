expression. For example, a crime eyewitness may have seen the perpetrator's face blurred by distance. This project aims to improve low-resolution face perception. Previous approaches have attempted only to improve general image visibility. Here, the novel theoretical idea is to alter the face's structure, tapping knowledge about higher-level face coding. Manipulations are caricaturing and whole-then-part alternation, as derived from face-space and holistic processing theories, respectively. Effects of viewpoint and own-versus-other race faces are expected to test practical generalisability of the new methods, and thus refine theory.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150100684", "id": "617721", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100684", "researchers": ["Prof Elinor McKone"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 518500, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:33Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100684", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100684", "DP150100684"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617721"}]}]}
