He received his PhD from the University of Tasmania in 1994, before undertaking postdoctoral research in the USA. Since returning to Australia in 2000, he has held prominent positions at the Baker Medical Research Institute and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne. Recently Ross brought together multi-disciplinary teams of laboratory and clinician researchers, and forged industry collaborations to devise \u2018first in class\u2019 RNA polymerase I inhibitors, that are now in clinical trial for a range of\u00a0 heamatologic cancers.

Subsequent growth of the heart is achieved by increasing the size of preexisting muscle cells. This process is referred to as hypertrophic growth and accounts for the difference in size between the juvenile and adult human heart. However later on in life, particularly during cardiovascular disease states such as high blood pressure, the adult heart may grow above and beyond that normally expected. This uncontrolled growth, results eventually in a sick heart which is no longer able to function properly. Such inappropriate growth of the heart is a component of many human cardiovascular disease states and contributes significantly to human morbidity and mortality. Regardless of the cause, hypertrophic growth of the heart results from increased protein synthesis. This is controlled by increased synthesis of ribosomes, the machinery responsible for making proteins. During the course of our studies investigating the regulation of heart muscle cell hypertrophy we have demonstrated that changes in the activity of a protein termed UBF, which is involved in regulating synthesis of ribosomes, correlates with the rate of hypertrophic growth. We have also demonstrated that if we artificially increase the amount of UBF protein in heart muscle cells we can stimulate hypertrophy. These finding indicate that alterations in the amount or activity of UBF may link hypertrophic stimuli to increased growth of the heart. The work described in this study proposes to investigate the signals and pathways which regulate the amount and activity of the UBF protein during hypertrophic growth of heart muscle cells. We hope by understanding the mechanisms by which the heart grows we will be able to design rational therapeutic regimens to combat the abnormal growth of the heart that often accompanies human cardiovascular disease states such as high blood pressure.", "title": "Mechanisms Regulating Ribosomal Gene Transcription During Cardiac Hypertrophy", "id": "99830", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/166900", "researchers": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 436540.16, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:25Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:56:33Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/166900", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/166900", "166900"], "subjects": ["321003", "In vitro mutagenesis and gene therapy", "cardiac muscle hypertrophy", "cardiomyocyte growth", "ribosomal gene transcription", "transcription factors regulation and promoter analysis", "cardiac hypertrophy", "cardiovascular disease", "hypertension"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/99830"}]}, {"description": "I am a cancer biologist determining the mechanisms controlling growth and proliferation of cancer cells and use transgenic models of malignancy and genetic approaches to identify new therapies for targeting growth control in the treatment of cancer.", "title": "Research Fellowship", "id": "110186", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1022402", "researchers": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 675736.7, "fundingScheme": "Research Fellowships", "startDate": 2012, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T07:45:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:20:40Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1022402", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1022402", "1022402"], "subjects": ["Cancer Cell Biology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS", "transcriptional regulation", "epigenetics", "cancer cell biology", "therapeutics", "growth regulation", "cancer biology", "transcription factor", "therapy", "mouse models", "translational research"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/110186"}]}, {"title": "Mechanisms regulating ribosomal gene transcription during cardiac hypertrophy", "id": "112870", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/166908", "researchers": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 441926.34, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Research Fellowships", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:25Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:24:22Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/166908", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/166908", "166908"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "N/A"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/112870"}]}, {"description": "A major feature ofcancer is accelerated cell growth and proliferation.
