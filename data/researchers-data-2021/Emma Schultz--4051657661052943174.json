Researchers invest considerable effort in understanding how demographics impact upon the need for, and structure of, government systems including social security and taxation, but relatively little is known about its effect on capital markets or corporate decision-making. Although individual investors are, by nature, atomistic, the project argues changes in investor preferences will ultimately prompt companies to alter their dividend policies. Pressure on firms to update these policies will come from superannuation and pension fund managers who, as fiduciaries, will invest money consistent with clients' revised preferences. The project aims to more fully characterise how Australia's ageing population will affect the public and private sectors.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160103037", "id": "664130", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103037", "researchers": ["Dr Emma Schultz", "Prof Garry Twite", "Prof Joseph Fan"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 310000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103037", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103037", "DP160103037"], "subjects": ["BANKING, FINANCE AND INVESTMENT", "COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664130"}]}]}
