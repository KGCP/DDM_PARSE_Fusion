OUTCOME: Construction and delivery of an optical fibre-positioning system to ESO resulting in leadership of an internationally competitive science programme for the entire community, and general access to ESOs premier survey facility for 8 Australian researchers.", "title": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities - Grant ID: LE150100055", "id": "618486", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE150100055", "researchers": ["Prof Simon Driver", "A/Prof Aaron Robotham", "Prof Christopher Power", "A/Prof Martin Meyer", "Prof Warrick Couch", "A/Prof Andrew Hopkins", "A/Prof Andrew Sheinis", "Dr Christopher Lidman", "Dr Sarah Brough", "Prof Matthew Colless", "Prof Martin Asplund", "Prof Brian Schmidt", "Prof Michael Drinkwater", "A/Prof Tamara Davis", "Dr David Parkinson", "Prof Karl Glazebrook", "A/Prof Christopher Blake", "A/Prof Darren Croton", "Prof Jonathan Bland-Hawthorn", "Prof Elaine Sadler", "A/Prof Scott Croom", "A/Prof Daniel Zucker", "Dr Richard McDermid", "Dr Lee Spitler", "Prof Carole Jackson", "Dr Michael Brown", "Prof Rachel Webster"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 560000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2015, "dateTimeModified": "2015-09-14T03:07:48Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE150100055", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE150100055", "LE150100055"], "subjects": ["ASTRONOMICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES", "ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTATION; FIBRE POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES; GALAXIES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618486"}]}]}
