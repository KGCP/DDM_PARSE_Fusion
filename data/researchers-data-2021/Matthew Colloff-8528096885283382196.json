Matt moved to Australia in 1994 to pursue a research career with CSIRO on soil biodiversity and ecosystem function. In 2007 Matt commenced research on the ecology and management of floodplains and wetlands, with an emphasis on the water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. In 2012 he shifted his focus towards adaptation to research on changing the ways that people think and act on adaptation to climate change, particularly on adaptation pathways and services and the interaction between values, rules and knowledge in adaptation decision making.
