Connecting contemporary Australian society with its material past is part of developing ideas about place, identity, and community. Using qualitative research and art practice-based studies, the project will trace the emergence of art-archaeology collaborations and investigate the application of visual methods in representing Australia&rsquo;s rich heritage. Through the visualisation of archaeology and heritage, the project seeks to further understand how the past is mediated in the present. This will enable better engagement in public discussions about what Australia is as a society and how it values its heritage.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE170101351", "id": "942826", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170101351", "researchers": ["Dr Ursula Frederick"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 335427, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:58Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170101351", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170101351", "DE170101351"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/942826"}]}]}
