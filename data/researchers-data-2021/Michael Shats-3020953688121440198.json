as sea search and rescue algorithms or diffusion of microorganisms in aquatic environments. For example, the patchiness in the distribution of phytoplankton can be related to the exposure of the microorganisms to turbulent flows. Recent progress in laboratory modelling of turbulence and the fabrication of artificial swimmers using Janus particles makes it possible to study these processes in laboratory. In this project we will undertake a first such study.
