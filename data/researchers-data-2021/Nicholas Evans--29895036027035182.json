hundreds of small languages. It hypothesises that exuberant linguistic diversification results from greater differences between how individuals speak in small-scale societies than in larger-scale ones. We will test this by matched case studies on languages from Arnhem Land, PNG and Vanuatu. The result will give insight into the paradox of why as a species we have so frequently evolved languages that limit who we can communicate with, and into the role of variability in maintaining or eroding the linguistic traditions of local communities.", "title": "Australian Laureate Fellowships - Grant ID: FL130100111", "id": "517452", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FL130100111", "researchers": ["Prof Nicholas Evans"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 3163655, "fundingScheme": "Australian Laureate Fellowships", "startDate": 2013, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:31Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FL130100111", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FL130100111", "FL130100111"], "subjects": ["LINGUISTICS", "LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE", "australian languages", "language documentation", "papuan languages"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517452"}]}, {"description": "Most babies who are born very preterm (less than 32 weeks' gestation; ie more than 2 months early) are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These babies stay in hospital for 2 to 4 months and need lots of care (using vast amounts of the available health resources). When compared to babies born at term, these very preterm babies are much more likely to die or to suffer from a range of poor outcomes that impact on their long-term development and quality of life. The Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN) is a collaboration of clinical staff in all 29 NICUs in the region, whose aim is to improve the care of high-risk newborn infants and their families in Australia and New Zealand through collaborative audit and research. This audit has reported considerable differences in the rates of death and poor outcomes between NICUs. Other networks have reported similar variations. Variations in outcomes could be due to 1) differences in the way the diagnosis is made in each unit, 2) differences in how small or ill the babies are when admitted, or 3) different quality of care in each NICU. We need to take account of the first two possibilities before we can compare NICUs fairly and allow them to work towards achieving the best outcomes for very premature babies. To do this, our project will use advanced statistical techniques to look at the risk factors associated with death and poor outcome in very preterm babies. We will then be able to 'predict' outcomes and see if the differences between NICUs are real or not. If the variation between units is explained by differences in clinical practices, then this has enormous potential for quality improvement within the NICUs and through the development of new policy guidelines for clinical practice. The statistical models developed during this project will be useful for clinicians in other health areas and in other countries.", "title": "Inter-hospital variations in outcomes of very preterm infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units", "id": "94398", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211088", "researchers": ["A/Pr Nicholas Evans", "Ms Deborah Donoghue", "Prof David Henderson-Smart", "Prof Judy Simpson"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 130440, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:55:59Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof David Henderson-Smart"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211088", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211088", "211088"], "subjects": ["321299", "Epidemiological Research Methods", "Neonatal", "Outcome Assessment (health care)", "Neonatal Brain Injury", "Neonatal Chronic Lung Disease", "Neonatal Intensive Care", "Neonatal mortality", "Retinopathy of Prematurity"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94398"}]}, {"description": "Survival rates for preterm babies are increasing, but the rate of disability is still high.
