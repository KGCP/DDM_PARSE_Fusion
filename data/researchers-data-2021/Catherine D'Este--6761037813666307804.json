About 345,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed in Australia each year. It is the second highest cause of death accounting for 27% of all deaths in Australia each year. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment have resulted in a growing number of people living with a history of cancer and for longer periods. Many cancer survivors report experiencing negative effects of cancer such as fatigue, anxiety, depression, and disrupted family and social relationships well after treatment has finished. Despite the large burden of this disease, little is known about the later effects that cancer and its treatment has on cancer survivors, their ongoing concerns, how the issues they face change over time and the type of support they need. This will be the first population-based longitudinal survey of the physical and psychosocial effects that cancer has on adult cancer survivors to be undertaken in Australia. It will follow cancer survivors for the first five years from diagnosis to provide data on important outcomes including anxiety, depression, quality of life and unmet needs. It will also provide the first population-based data on the predictors of these outcomes, including social support, coping style and patient demographic, treatment and disease characteristics. Given the large-scale cancer survivorship initiatives underway internationally, it is timely for high quality and comprehensive Australian data to be obtained. These data will provide new information on how the physical, social and emotional impact of cancer changes with time since diagnosis and a better understanding of the support desired by cancer survivors at various stages of recovery or disease progression. This information will help guide the development of policies and services that are tailored to the needs of Australian cancer survivors.", "title": "A population-based longitudinal study of cancer survivors' psychosocial and physical well being", "id": "95250", "institutions": ["University of Newcastle"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252418", "researchers": ["Dr Allison Boyes", "Prof Catherine D'Este", "Prof Afaf Girgis"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 454600, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:04Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:36Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Newcastle"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Afaf Girgis"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252418", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252418", "252418"], "subjects": ["321299", "behavioural epidemiology", "cancer", "longitudinal study", "population health", "psychosocial factors", "adult cancer", "cancer sequelae", "patient related health outcomes", "population heatlh", "psychosocial"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95250"}]}, {"description": "Smoking among the socially disadvantaged is unacceptably high.

Although significant improvements in the early detection and treatment of cancer have increased survival, these advancements may have added to the psychological, physical and resource burdens placed on patients by increasing the time between diagnosis and definitive outcome. Addressing the physical and psychological needs of cancer patients throughout the course of their illness has become an important component care. A potential mechanism for reducing the psychological morbidity associated with cancer is to intervene to reduce a patient's level of unmet needs. This proposal intends to test the cost-effectiveness of an innovative intervention to reduce the level of unmet needs among colorectal patients. The study involves recruiting patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer within the past 3 months through the cancer registry and assessing their level of unmet needs at four points-at entry into the study: 6-, 12- and 18- months post diagnosis. Experimental subjects will be assigned a specially trained volunteer worker attached to the cancer council to aid the patient in identifying resources to address their unmet needs. The volunteer will act as an information resource and emotional support person. The volunteer will access information about the patients unmet needs from study questionnaires, and work with patients to devise a plan for addressing their unmet needs. The study will determine whether the level of unmet needs among cancer patients can be reduced in this manner and whether this strategy also reduces psychological distress. The proposed research is unique as it could highlight mechanisms that could be utilised by all cancer councils in Australia. The intervention has the additional benefit of being able to reach all cancer patients in a particular state regardless of their geographic location or where they receive treatment.", "title": "Reducing cancer patients psychosocial needs.

In 1998, about half of all males and a third of all females drank at least once a month at levels that placed them at risk of harm. In NSW, alcohol was estimated as being a causal factor in about one-quarter of all road traffic deaths in 1995 and was associated with a 58% increase in hospital utilistion rates between 1988-89 and 1990-91. The burden of suffering appears disproportionately higher in rural areas of NSW: per capita rate of convictions associated with a prescribed alcohol concentration in rural towns was approximately double that in metropolitan areas in 2000. The rate of attendances at hospital accident and emergency departments was also higher in rural areas. These data suggest a need for additional effort to reduce alcohol-related harm in rural, relative to metropolitan, areas. In Australia, there have been no well-controlled, community-based, attempts to reduce alcohol-related harm by simultaneously implementing a range of interventions. The conduct of a large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness of this approach is difficult to justify, due to the substantial costs associated with such a rigorous design. However, a less rigorus, though equally valid, design, such as a stepped wedged approach, would likely provide good evidence to justify the subsequent conduct of an RCT. If the expected outcomes are not achieved, the conduct of an RCT can be postponed until reasonable preliminary evidence regarding the types of community-based interventions most likely to be effective is obtained.
