Phenotypic plasticity (the ability to change phenotype with environment) determines natural populations&rsquo; immediate response to environmental change. However, studies of plasticity frequently rely on simplifying assumptions, and understanding the genomic and epigenomic mechanisms underlying plasticity is only just emerging. This project will combine a fine-scale temperature-manipulation experiment with genomic and multivariate statistical analyses of a native Australian alpine plant. The intended outcome is a comprehensive analysis of whether multi-trait phenotypic plasticity is adaptive; whether it can evolve; and the epigenomic mechanisms that drive it. The project will predict the likely effect of temperature change on alpine plants, and so generate information internationally relevant to the management of populations adapting to climate change and locally relevant to the conservation of Australian montane flora.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP170101681", "id": "943585", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170101681", "researchers": ["Prof Loeske Kruuk", "Prof Adrienne Nicotra", "Asst Prof Christina Richards"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 459500, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:45:02Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170101681", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170101681", "DP170101681"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/943585"}]}, {"description": "Local adaptation is hypothesized to be critical for restoration but under disturbed and changing environments, narrow genetic diversity may limit success. We propose a Genome Wide Association Study to map adaptive loci in two Eucalyptus species with broad environmental envelopes in eastern and Western Australia, to identify causative loci and population structure defining local climate adaptation. This will enable genomic selection of high quality families to improve restoration success under future variable climates.
