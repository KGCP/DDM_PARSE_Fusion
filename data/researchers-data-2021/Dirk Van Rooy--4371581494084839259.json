is, as well as the social and psychological factors affecting these beliefs. If people believe their own intergroup attitudes (even negative ones) to be correct and normative, anti-prejudice appeals will likely be rejected. What is needed, then, is an analysis of what people believe to be prejudice or not in the first place, and how these beliefs are changed. This project aims to provide this analysis via qualitative and quantitative experimental social-psychological research. Project outcomes are expected to clarify social&ndash;psychological theory, offering new insight into how anti-prejudice arguments can be successful.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160101157", "id": "663887", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101157", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Platow", "Prof Martha Augoustinos", "Prof Dr Russell Spears", "Prof Daniel Bar-Tal", "Dr Dirk Van Rooy"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 322000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101157", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101157", "DP160101157"], "subjects": ["PSYCHOLOGY", "PSYCHOLOGY AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663887"}]}]}
