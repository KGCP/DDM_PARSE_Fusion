Research has demonstrated that RJ is a powerful response to a wide variety of governance challenges and could provide a useful alternative paradigm for environmental regulation. This project aims to apply the processes and values of RJ to environmental regulation with a focus on harm prevention, advancing theory into a new domain of application. This should lead to immediate and long-term benefits, including better prevention of environmental harm, better relationships with communities, and stronger commitments by those who have caused harm to rehabilitate, repair and reform.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP170100906", "id": "1344149", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP170100906", "researchers": ["Dr Miranda Forsyth", "Prof John Braithwaite", "Prof Valerie Braithwaite", "Dr Cathy Wilkinson", "Ms Deborah Hollingworth"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 346297, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:57Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-02T04:21:15Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP170100906", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP170100906", "LP170100906"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1344149"}]}]}
