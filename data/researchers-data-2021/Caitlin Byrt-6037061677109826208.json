synthesis and interconversion of nucleotide sugars is regulated and how this controls the properties of arabinoxylan in economically important plants. Dietary consumption of arabinoxylan reduces chronic diseases. Additionally, the attributes of arabinoxylan influence the cost of processing plant biomass. However, genetic control of the properties of the plant polysaccharide arabinoxylan is unresolved. A major control point in the partitioning of carbon from photosynthesis into arabinoxylan is the activity of sugar nucleotide interconverting enzymes. To characterise these enzymes, genomic, glycomic and enzyme kinetic data will be combined and the target enzymes will be modified in transgenic plants.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE150100837", "id": "617511", "institutions": ["University of Adelaide"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE150100837", "researchers": ["Dr Caitlin Byrt"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 354000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Adelaide"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE150100837", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE150100837", "DE150100837"], "subjects": ["PLANT BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "CARBON PARTITIONING; CEREAL GRAINS; PLANT CELL WALL"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617511"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to increase our understanding of how plant cells regulate solute transport. Crop growth depends on water uptake and transport, and the rapid movement of water across plant cell membranes requires transporters such as aquaporins. Preliminary data indicates that a series of signals can switch aquaporins between functioning as highly selective water channels and salt transport channels. The project aims to reveal the molecular pathways that regulate water and salt co-transport, using genetics, molecular biology, and electrophysiology data to decipher how plants regulate and coordinate aquaporin solute transport during growth and in osmotic adjustment. The project has the potential to lead to improvements in crop-plant solute transport traits, enhanced agricultural productivity, and yield stability in saline and water limited environments.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT180100476", "id": "1344026", "institutions": ["University of Adelaide"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100476", "researchers": ["Dr Caitlin Byrt"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 728125, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-02T04:21:12Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Adelaide"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100476", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100476", "FT180100476"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1344026"}]}, {"description": "Water and salt are critical factors for the Australian agricultural industry.
