Biological fluidic flows in vasculature, microfluidics and in the interstitial space possess important physical traits that drive cellular mechanics and tissue remodelling. Steve's interest is to unravel hidden biological fluidic transport and 4D cellular network in the extracellular matrix (ECM), cellular networks and platelet aggregates using advanced bioimaging tools, especially in the\u00a0interstitial spaces that is largely unknown. His group's work has been reported interdisciplinary biomethods journals such as Nature Protocols, Lab On Chip, Biophys J, Cell, Biomed Opt Exp, Blood Advances, Sci Rep, Advanced Biosyst as well as specialised physical sciences journals such Opt Lett, Physical Review A, Opt Express, App Phys Lett etc.Steve has assembled a team of multi-disciplinary imaging scientists (optics, biochemistry, machine learning) that can build cutting edge 4D, 5D optical microscopy tools\u00a0 (non-commerically available) so as to tailor each to investigate fluid flow in a biological relevant models (microfluidics, organiods and mice model). For example, his team developed Raster Adaptive Optics (RAO, patent pending-\u00a02019904929) formed the basis for 2x National in vivo Imaging Initiatives (ACRF InCite and ARC-LIEF) to study immune and cancer cells in ECM in mice models. His label-free high resolution imaging of blood thrombus (COSI) is used by National Platelet Referral Centre for early diagnosis in embolisment using microchips.Video
