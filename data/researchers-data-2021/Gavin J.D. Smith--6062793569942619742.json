I am now actively researching these kinds of relations as they pertain to the use of facial recognition technologies in various contexts as part of an ARC Discovery Project, When your face is your ID: Public responses to automated facial recognition (2020-2024)Other current research I'm doing explores the ambiguous figure of the snake in Australian society. This is a double edged project examining social and cultural perceptions of snakes, both historically and in the contemporary period, but also how social agents engage with these animals in everyday life. Building on the sociality of snakes, the second component of the research involves conducting snake ecology research, and tracking a sample of Eastern brown snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) in Canberra to better determine habitat use and movement profiles post-release.\u00a0Twitter: @gavin_jd_smith"], "biography": "I am an international collaborator on The New Transparency Project (an MCRI project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada) and an editor of Surveillance & Society.
