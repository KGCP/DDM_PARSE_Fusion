These are listed below. I also have a long track-record in work on ageing and new technologies of care.I am currently working on reproductive biosensing and self-tracking, and developing an international project on new formations of the menopause, working with sociologists, activists and artists in the UK.\u00a0 I have a strong interest in feminist and queer theory and how they can help us understand how human and non-human bodies are changing in the current era of environmental disaster.Another line of research concerns the rise of neuroscientifically-informed parenting practices and popular, therapeutic and biomedical accounts of the effects of early-life trauma throughout childhood and adult life.
