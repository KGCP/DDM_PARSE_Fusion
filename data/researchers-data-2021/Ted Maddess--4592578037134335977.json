the brain, will be tested for its effectiveness in diagnosing and tracking progression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and the degree to which it complements Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Our understanding of MS has changed in recent years. It is now recognised to have two phases: an initial inflammatory phase, and a secondary progressive phase. The progressive phase produces the inexorable increasing disability of MS. MS only affects about 0.04% of Australians but the early onset of MS, the high cost of medication, and the prolonged period of disability, mean that the cost to Australia is about $2 billion pa. MRI quantifies the inflammatory phase well but is poorly correlated with the debilitating secondary progression. The common treatments for MS target the inflammatory phase but not the causes of secondary progression, which are unknown. Current diagnostic methods mean diagnosis can take years, meaning that patients can be denied treatment for some time. The applicants have published experiments on 50 MS patients and 27 normal subjects using a variant of the new method. Not only has it shown high diagnostic accuracy, but the new method seems to provide data on the progressive phase, suggesting strongly that it is complementary to MRI. The new method is also much cheaper to set up and run than MRI and so could provide cost-effective means for monitoring patient condition and testing new drugs that are effective against the progressive phase. The applicants have considerable experience commercialising diagnostic technologies, and are currently working with an Australian company developing new diagnostic hardware. That hardware has been adapted to perform the presently proposed experiments. Overall it is reasonable to assume that positive outcomes will be translated into economic and health benefits for Australians.", "title": "Rapid, cost-effective, diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis by novel multifocal evoked potential methods", "id": "97894", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418029", "researchers": ["A/Pr Andrew James", "Prof Ted Maddess", "Prof Christian Lueck"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 152463.89, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Development Grants", "startDate": 2008, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:35Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ted Maddess"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418029", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418029", "418029"], "subjects": ["Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "NEUROSCIENCES", "cortical evoked potentials", "electrophysiological measures", "evoked response potentials", "magnetic resonance imaging", "multiple sclerosis", "brain function", "diagnostic methods", "vision screening"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97894"}]}, {"description": "The majority of the structure within natural images is due to 3rd to 5th order correlations between image points.
