My area of  research interest centers on images, specifically photo credibility. Key to my  research is the important distinction between photographs (photos of  real people, places and events) and manipulated images or photoart (images that were once  photos but have now been changed by image manipulation software).This  research fits into my overall goals of contributing to the way  education and information empower beneficial change in the world.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Investigating differences in two visualisations from observer", "year": "2018", "source": "s fixations and saccades'2018 Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference, ACSW 2018, ACM, New York, NY, USA, pp. 1-4", "authors": ["Hossain M", "Gedeon T", "Sabrina Caldwell"]}, {"title": "Detecting the Doubt Effect and Subjective Beliefs Using Neural Networks and Observers", "year": "2018", "source": "Pupillary Responses'25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing, ICONIP 2018, ed.
