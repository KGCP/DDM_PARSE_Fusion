Our main recommendations \u2014 that Australia should abandon all its  exchange controls and float the dollar \u2014 were adopted by the Committee against  the then strong opposition of Treasury and the Reserve Bank. I worked in Jakarta  in 1987 for the Ministry of Industry and the World Bank as leader of a  three-person team that studied effective protection and options for liberalising  trade policy. I have since worked as a consultant for the World Bank in  Indonesia (on a further five missions), Trinidad and Tobago (twice), Ghana,  Madagascar, Georgia, Yemen, Ethiopia and Iran (three times, most recently in  July 2001). I have consulted on tax policy for the New Zealand Treasury (three  times), for the UNDP in Sri Lanka and for UNIDO in Bulgaria. In 1999, I wrote a  report on Policies for Reducing the Destabilising Effects of Short-term Capital  Flows for the Institution Building in Asia Project that was co-ordinated by the  Research Institute for Asia and the Pacific (Sydney University) for the Ministry  of Finance of the Government of Japan.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Indonesia", "year": "2009", "source": "in Kym
