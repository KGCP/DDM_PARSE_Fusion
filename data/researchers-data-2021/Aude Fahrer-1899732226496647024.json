The Nessy mouse strain was developed in Prof. Goodnow s Medical Genome Centre at the Australian National University. It has a mutation in an unknown gene which causes a defect in T lymphocytes- white blood cells which are important for fighting infection. This project has three major aims: 1) to identify the gene. 2) to understand the defects in T lymphocytes caused by the gene. 3) to identify which other genes interact with the mutant gene. Thus will allow us to understand how the mutant gene causes the T lymphocyte defects. This project will improve our understanding of the development and functioning of T lymphocytes, which play a central role in the immune system. Since the genomes of mice and humans are very similar, it is likely that we will be able to identify a human counterpart to the Nessy gene.", "title": "Identification and characterisation of \"Nessy\"; a novel gene important for T cell differentiation.", "id": "82814", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224227", "researchers": ["Dr Aude Fahrer"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 250500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:53Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Dr Aude Fahrer"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224227", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224227", "224227"], "subjects": ["320204", "T lymphocytes", "bioinformatics", "gene mapping", "immune development", "molecular mechanisms", "T cell immunity", "finding new genes", "identification of genes leading to disease", "immune system disorder"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82814"}]}]}
