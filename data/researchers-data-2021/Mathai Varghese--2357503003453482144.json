Since Atiyah-Bott, Donaldson, Hitchin, and Seiberg-Witten&rsquo;s work on various equations in gauge theory, profound applications have changed the geometry and topology of low dimensional manifolds. Parametrised index theory has obtained deep results on the topology of metrics of positive scalar curvature in higher dimensions, but these methods do not work in the case of the fourth dimension. This project will develop (parametrised) Seiberg-Witten gauge theory as a new approach to the study of the topology of metrics of positive scalar curvature in four dimensions. Expected outcomes include new invariants related to positive scalar curvature in four dimensions.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP170101054", "id": "943366", "institutions": ["University of Adelaide"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170101054", "researchers": ["Prof Mathai Varghese", "Dr David Baraglia"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 335000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:45:01Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Adelaide"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170101054", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170101054", "DP170101054"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/943366"}]}]}
