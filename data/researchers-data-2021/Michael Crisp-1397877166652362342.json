We found that long distance dispersal had been far more common that previously supposed and published the results in Nature. In another study, published in Nature Communications, we discovered that fire-dominated eucalypt communities were likely present in Australia when it was part of Gondwana, 50 million years earlier than previously thought. Hence, eucalypts likely played an early role in transforming the continent from a rainforest-dominated landscape to one of open, flammable sclerophyll communities. This transformation was made possible by a unique adaptation in eucalypts to resprout after even the most intense bushfires from dormant buds in their bark.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Pleistocene divergence of two disjunct conifers in the eastern Australian temperate zone", "year": "2018", "source": "Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, vol. 125, no. 3, pp. 459-474", "authors": ["Worth J", "Sakaguchi S", "Harrison P", "Michael Crisp"]}, {"title": "monograph of Daviesia (Mirbelieae, Faboideae, Fabaceae)", "year": "2017", "source": "Phytotaxa, vol. 300, no. 1, pp. 1-308", "authors": ["Michael Crisp", "Cayzer L", "Chandler G"]}, {"title": "Congruent biogeographical disjunctions at a continent-wide scale: Quantifying and clarifying the role of biogeographic barriers in the Australian tropics", "year": "2017", "source": "PLOS ONE (Public Library of Science), vol. 12, no. 4, pp. e0174812-e0174812", "authors": ["Edwards R", "Michael Crisp", "Cook D"]}, {"title": "ustralia lacks stem succulents but is it depauperate in plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)?", "year": "2016", "source": "Current Opinion in Plant Biology, vol. 31, pp. 109-117", "authors": ["Holtum J", "Hancock L", "Edwards E", "Michael Crisp"]}, {"title": "Interpreting the modern distribution of Myrtaceae using a dated molecular phylogeny", "year": "2015", "source": "Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, vol. 93, pp. 29-43", "authors": ["Thornhill A", "Ho S", "Kulheim C", "Michael Crisp"]}, {"title": "Key innovation or adaptive change?
