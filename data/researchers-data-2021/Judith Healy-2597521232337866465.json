[{"description": "This project draws together data from nine Australian Longitudinal Studies of Ageing (LSAs), including 53484 participants, that will be used to identify factors capable of preventing disease, reducing ill-health, and promoting engaged and successful ageing for Australians. The focus is upon conditions that significantly contribute to the burden of disease including cognitive decline and dementia, sensory impairment, impairment in mobility and common mental disorders such as depression. Although individual studies contain rich data on particular topics, there is only a small number of individuals in each study with specific medical conditions, or combinations of different conditions, especially at the older ages. Pooling data from nine studies will overcome this problem. This innovative and interdisciplinary study also involves development of the first Australian dynamic micro-simulation model of the health and social outcomes of the baby boomer and older cohorts. The simulation will allow for evaluation of the impact of modifying risk factors, and costs associated with different trajectories of health and ageing. Our program takes an interdisciplinary life course approach, incorporating interdependencies among demographic, behavioural, social, economic and health factors. Our multidisciplinary team and collaborative pooling of existing studies adds value and builds upon experience, as recommended in the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council 2003 report. The outcomes will direct health and social policy to promote health behaviour, and social and medical interventions to compress morbidity and optimize healthy ageing in Australian society over the next 40 years.", "title": "Using health outcome data from pooled Longitudinal Studies of Ageing to develop statistical and microsimulation models t", "id": "98980", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410215", "researchers": ["Prof Kaarin Anstey", "Prof Peter Butterworth", "A/Pr Judith Healy", "Prof David Steel", "Prof Julie Byles", "Prof Colette Browning", "Prof Mary Luszcz", "Prof Paul Mitchell", "Prof Ann Harding", "Prof Gary Andrews", "Dr Heather Booth", "Prof Robert Cumming", "Prof Laurie Brown"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 2162630.8, "fundingScheme": "Targeted Calls", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2013, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-16T09:52:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:46:24Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Kaarin Anstey"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410215", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410215", "410215"], "subjects": ["321299", "Ageing", "Cognitive imparment", "Cohort studies", "Eye disease and Hearing loss", "Psychosocial factors and comorbidity"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98980"}]}]}
