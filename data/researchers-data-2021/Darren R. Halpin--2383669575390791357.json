I explore these themes in work on Australia, the US, United Kingdom and comparatively.\u00a0My first book Groups, Democracy and Representation: Between Promise and Practice (2010, Manchester University Press), probed what we should expect groups to contribute to democratic representation. My follow up book The Organization of Political Interest Groups: Designing Advocacy (2014, Routledge), pioneers an organisational social science perspective on interest groups, spanning group formation through to policy influence.Later this year my new book, with Anthony J.
