escalating health issue. They cause severe disease with a high death rate and are very costly to the health system. This is especially the case in immunocompromised patients, such as those with blood malignancies, organ transplant recipients and AIDS. The number of currently available drugs for the treatment of fungal infections is limited and they are, in general, either not very effective or toxic. The development of fungal strains resistant to these drugs is also becoming problematic. There is an urgent need to discover and develop new drugs effective against fungal infections through identifying new targets in the fungal cell and-or targets that prevent the spread of infection in the human host. We were the first to describe an enzyme, phospholipase B (PLB1), which is secreted by the medically important fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and is important in invasion of human tissue by the fungus. It is also important in remodelling of membranes in the fungal cell. This enzyme is sufficiently different from human phospholipases to be a good target for antifungal drugs. In this project, we aim to synthesise and test molecules which should inhibit the activity of PLB and in this way block its harmful effects. We will test the effects of such drugs to make sure they do not interfere with human enzyme systems. Inhibitory compounds may also be used to kill the fungal cells, especially if administered together with currently used therapies. The design and development of new antifungal drugs with a novel mode of action represents a major advance in the treatment of fungal disease, and a saving of some A$60000 per affected patient (estimated from a recent US study).", "title": "Fungal Phospholipases: A Novel Drug Discovery Platform", "id": "81314", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/402413", "researchers": ["Prof Tania Sorrell", "Prof Katrina Jolliffe", "A/Pr David Ellis"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 588679.4, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:08Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:46:59Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Katrina Jolliffe"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/402413", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/402413", "402413"], "subjects": ["Medical Microbiology not elsewhere classified", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY", "antifungal", "drug design", "enzyme inhibition", "fungal pathogens", "mycology", "drug discovery", "enzyme inhibitors as pharmacological agents", "fungal infection", "phospholipase B as drug target"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/81314"}]}, {"description": "Pathogenic fungi are becoming increasingly important in causing potentially life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised hosts (e.g. AIDS, transplant patients). Many of the emerging fungal pathogens are inherently resistent to triazole antifungal drugs and clinical responses to established drugs remain suboptimal, despite apparent sensitivity in the laboratory. Current techniques of fungal identification are insensitive, unspecific, slow, labour-intensive and require skilled personnel for the ID of less common fungi. To improve clinical outcomes by prompt selection-initiation of the best antifungal regimes, and to truncate the interval from initiation of therapy to cure, early, accurate identification of the causative agent is crucial, making a fast identification to the species level after culture or direct from clinical specimens a necessity. A correct fungal identification can only be achieved if the phylogenetic relationships between the pathogenic organisms and their taxonomy is resolved. Gene detection is more reproducible than detection of morphological and biochemical differences. The proposal focuses on the establishment of an accurate phylogenetic system of pathogenic fungi, which will form the basis of a universally applicable molecular identification system and to develop a molecular reference database for human pathogenic fungi. This project will contribute sequence data of pathogenic fungi to the Tree of Life project. This project unites expertise in classical mycology, molecular biology, bioinformatics and infectious diseases, to develop an accurate phylogeny of medically important fungi, providing a unique opportunity to establish a quality controlled reference database accessible via the world-wide-web.
