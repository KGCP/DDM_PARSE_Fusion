As cities face increasing pressures, the challenges of governing everyday habits prompt urgent questions about how habits are understood and managed. This project will study the governance of 'city habits' from the late 19th century to the present. The project will apply and deepen its description of habit through case studies focused on contemporary Sydney. Its findings are expected to benefit city planners and policy makers by informing the organisation and regulation of habits.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP170100263", "id": "943000", "institutions": ["University of Western Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170100263", "researchers": ["Prof Tony Bennett", "Prof Gay Hawkins", "Prof Gregory Noble", "Prof Nikolas Rose"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 360500, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:59Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170100263", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170100263", "DP170100263"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/943000"}]}, {"description": "This interdisciplinary project investigates the shaping of Australian art, literary, media, sport, and heritage fields, individually and collectively, by the changing national and transnational environment since the 1994 national cultural policy Creative Nation.
