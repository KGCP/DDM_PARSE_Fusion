It is susceptible to stress in strong light and my research deals with relationships between the two reversible processes of photoprotection and photoinactivation. Photoprotection involves pigment-protein transformations in the light harvesting antennae of chloroplasts that lead to the dumping of excess light as heat. Shade leaves of tropical plants, such as avocado, have two carotenoid based pigment cycles that have established a particular photoprotective function for the xanthophyll pigment lutein. Photoinactivation involves events in the water splitting reaction centre in chloroplasts that lead to the destruction of core proteins, loss of function and a cycle of repair. Studies of these events in-vivo depend heavily on non-intrusive methods using chlorophyll fluorescence. These techniques are also applied in environmental plant physiology and ecology to determine the interaction of strong light with high temperature, water and nutritional stresses, and some can be scaled up for remote sensing in canopies"], "biography": "Member, Integrated Biological Systems Steering Committee, DIISR (2009-11)", "project": ["Photoprotective functions of xanthophyll pigments in avocado", "Studies of shade leaves\u00a0in some tropical plants\u00a0(including avocado) that have two carotenoid based pigment cycles have established a particular photoprotective function for the xanthophyll pigment lutein.", "Papers from this project:", "Jia HS, Forster B, Chow WS, Pogson BJ, Osmond CB (2013) Deacreased photochemical efficiency of Photosystem II following sunlight exposure of shade-grown leaves of avocado (Persea americana Mill.): because of, or in spite of, two kinetically distinct xanthophyll cycles.
