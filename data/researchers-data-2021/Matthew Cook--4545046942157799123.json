We operate at the interface between contemporary clinical practice and discovery, with overarching aims of improving diagnostic accuracy and devising more precise treatments through better understanding of disease mechanisms.Characterising human genetic variation is a potentially powerful method for discovering mechanisms of disease. In some cases, a diagnosis of Mendelian disease can be made through WGS, and therefore we have implemented a diagnostic genomics service (Canberra Clinical Genomics). In other cases, whole genome sequencing identifies genetic variants that provide clues to mechanisms of disease. Our lab investigates the functional consequences of genetic variants using biochemistry and cellular immunology. In order to understand how genetically encoded changes in immunity cause pathology, we also develop bespoke models of human disease by engineering orthologous gene variants in mouse models using CRISPR/cas9. We have been applying this approach to many different types of immunological disease, but particularly primary antibody deficiency, autoimmunity and sarcoidosis."], "biography": "", "project": ["How do genetic variants affecting NF-kB cause autoimmunity and immune deficiency?", "In this project we are investigating several rare Mendelian disorders of NF-kB to understand how defects in these transcription factors alter central T cell tolerance, T and B cell development, and normal immune responses to infection.", "AUTOCheck: immune related adverse events from checkpoint inhibitors", "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the management of many forms of cancer but sometimes treatment is complicated by development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases.

It is characterised by inflammation that can damage virtually any organ in the body. This inflammation is the outcome of a complex interplay between the environment and genetic predisposition, resulting in production of antibodies against components of normal tissue. Better characterisation of the genetic basis of lupus is a priority because it is the single best path towards a clearer understanding of the mechanism of this debilitating disease, and ultimately, new therapeutic options. Strategies used to identify the genetic basis of human disease fall into two categories. The first involves gathering genetic information from families with more than one affected member, which is then compared with genetic information from unaffected people. This can identify genetic regions likely to contain disease-causing genes, but so far, this approach has met with limited success in lupus. Although regions of the genome that harbour disease-associated genes have been found, few actual disease causing genes have been confirmed. The second approach begins with known genes that might plausibly cause the disease, based on prior knowledge then tests are performed to see whether particular variants of these genes are more common in patients than in healthy controls. Obviously this approach is usually biased towards investigation of candidate genes that are already well-characterised. In this project, we will combine information obtained from a large-scale mouse-based programme in which genetic changes that cause features of lupus are generated randomly. In other words, there is an unbiased search for candidate genes, which should lead to the discovery of new disease pathways. Since the mouse and human immune systems are remarkably similar, genetic abnormalities that cause features of lupus in mice are highly likely to be informative about the genetic basis of human lupus, a hypothesis we will test with genetic studies in humans with lupus.", "title": "Translational study of the genetics of systemic autoimmunity based on mouse mutagenesis", "id": "94895", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316914", "researchers": ["Prof Matthew Cook", "Prof Carola Vinuesa", "Prof Gavin Huttley", "Prof Christopher Goodnow"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 518500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:49:59Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:24Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Christopher Goodnow"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316914", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316914", "316914"], "subjects": ["Autoimmunity", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "IMMUNOLOGY", "Antinuclear antibodies", "ENU mutagenesis", "Human lupus alleles", "Lupus", "Mouse lupus alleles", "Autoimmune thrombocytopenia", "Systemic autoimmunity"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94895"}]}, {"description": "Our research recently described a mouse that shows excellent similarities to human inflammatory bowel diseases.
