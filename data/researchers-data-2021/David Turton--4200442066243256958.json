I also have an ongoing research interest in the ombudsman institution, with a recent focus on the ACT's Office of the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment. My PhD examined aspects of Australia's coal seam gas controversy, with an emphasis on the sector's legal geography, publishing several papers from this work. A recent offshoot of this research is a book chapter that explores the place of lawyers in legal geography research methods and the challenges and opportunities this profession presents to researchers.", "project": ["ACT Office of the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment"], "publication": [{"title": "Lawyers In Legal Geography: Parliamentary submissions and coal seam gas in Australia", "year": "2020", "source": "in T O'Donnell, D Robinson & J Gillespie (ed.), Legal Geography: Perspectives and Methods, Routledge, London, UK, pp. 221-239", "authors": ["David Turton"]}, {"title": "Fracturing planners: A study of their contribution to Australia", "year": "2019", "source": "s coal seam gas debate'The Extractive Industries and Society, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 1314-1324", "authors": ["David Turton"]}, {"title": "Legal determinations, geography and justice in Australia", "year": "2017", "source": "s coal seam gas debate'in Lukasiewicz, A., Dovers, S., Robin, L., McKay, J.M., Schilizzi, S., Graham, S.
