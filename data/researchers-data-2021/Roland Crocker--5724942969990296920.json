This project will investigate two possible agents for this inefficiency, the pressures exerted by starlight photons and the relativistic cosmic rays produced by supernovae, using a combination of numerical simulations, basic physical analysis, and comparison to observations. The expected outcome will be a greatly improved understanding of the physics of the interaction of radiation and cosmic rays with star-forming interstellar gas. This will help complete the picture of how galaxies like our own came to be, and will provide tools for both future simulations and the interpretation of observations.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190101258", "id": "1378366", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101258", "researchers": ["Prof Mark Krumholz", "Dr Roland Crocker", "A/Prof Todd Thompson"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 430000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:46Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101258", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101258", "DP190101258"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378366"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to ensure Australia&rsquo;s contribution to the five-year production phase of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a very high energy gamma-ray astronomy instrument that is expected to transform both high energy astrophysics and astro-particle physics.
