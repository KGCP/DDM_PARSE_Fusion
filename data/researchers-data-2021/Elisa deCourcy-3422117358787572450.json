Elisa's work largely examines photo histories, including but going beyond European and American metropoles, assessing cultures of experimentation and appropriation. From 2016-2019 she was the Research Fellow on 'Heritage in the Limelight: The magic lantern in Australia and the world' ARC Discovery Project run out of the School of Art and Design, ANU. During this period she also worked on a second Discovery Project, 'Curating Photography in the Age of Photosharing' (2015-2019), co-administered between ANU and RMIT. She has spoken and published about her research in Australia and abroad. In 2018 she was awarded a Harry Ransom Fellowship from the University of Texas at Austin and an Australian Academy of the Humanities Publishing Subsidy Award in 2019. Both of these grants contribute to an extended book project 'Empire, Early Photography and Spectacle: the global career of showman daguerreotypist J.W. Newland', co-authored with Martyn Jolly, released by Routledge in January 2021. From April 2020 she will be an Australian Research Council DECRA fellow on her own project 'Capturing Foundational Australian Photography in a Globalising World' also based at ANU.\u00a0Her scholarship is informed by deep archival research, practice-led investigation and a re-thinking of digital design for photographically-centred heritage collections.\u00a0Her work has been covered by\u00a0The Guardian, The Smithsonian Magazine, and\u00a0The Conversation.", "project": ["Capturing foundational Australian photography in a globalising world (DECRA 2020-2023)\u00a0DE200101322", "This project will combine archival research on the foundational years of Australian photography, 1839-54, with new methods of multimedia database design to network early photographs: daguerreotypes, ambrotypes and calotypes, with dispersed manuscripts, journalism and legal proceedings that document their creation. These images are prized by Australian collecting institutions but their significance to our cultural heritage remains unrecognised. This project will analyse how colonial Australian photographers\u2019 distance from Europe prompted them to innovate with processes, materials and apparatuses.
