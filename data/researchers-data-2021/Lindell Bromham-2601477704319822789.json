life. Dates estimated from DNA sequences have a wide range of applications, including evolutionary biology, conservation prioritisation and epidemiology. These methods rely on accurate rate estimates, but current models lack information about the biological drivers of rates of genomic change. This project will test reliability of current methods, identify potentially misleading estimates of disease origin or conservation priorities, and develop new approaches with empirically-informed models of rate change.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190101916", "id": "1378472", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101916", "researchers": ["Prof Lindell Bromham"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 462000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:47Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101916", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101916", "DP190101916"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378472"}]}, {"description": "The project seeks to investigate the capacity of iconic Australian plant groups (Eucalyptus, Acacia, Banksia, Grevillea, Hakea) to adapt to increases in extreme conditions. Australia presents many extreme conditions for plant survival, such as drought, heat, or salt-affected soils. Are some lineages better able to adapt and diversify in these conditions? This project aims to develop new methods to identify lineages most tolerant of extreme environments, detect enabling traits that contribute to stress resistance, and test whether plant assemblages in extreme environments are formed from colonisation by specialist tolerators, or by local species adapting. These methods may allow the prediction of species or communities best able to adapt to conditions expected under global environmental change.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160103915", "id": "664243", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103915", "researchers": ["Prof Lindell Bromham", "A/Prof Marcel Cardillo"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 378700, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:39Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103915", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103915", "DP160103915"], "subjects": ["EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664243"}]}]}
