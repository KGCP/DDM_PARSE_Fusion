(Hons) and a Ph.D. from the University of Newcastle. He is currently a Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. Previously, he worked at the Bureau of Mineral Resources/AGSO/Geoscience Australia from 1984 to 2014. His work involves studies of mineral systems and the geochemical modelling of fluids and alteration associated with ore deposits and he has over 30 years experience in fluid inclusion, laser Raman and infrared spectroscopic techniques. He is a Fellow of the Geological Society of Australia and has over 100 refereed publications in scientific journals. These publications cover work on a large variety of mineral deposits including copper mineralisation at Mt Isa, gold deposits in the Yilgarn Craton, Pilbara Craton, Lachlan Fold Belt, Tennant Creek, and the Tanami region, unconformity uranium deposits in the Northern Territory, tin-tungsten deposits in the New England Fold Belt and China, VHMS deposits at Hellyer and Mt. Chalmers, porphyry copper-gold deposits in Papua and the Philippines, platinum group minerals in layered intrusions in the Pilbara Block, and a number of related mineralogical studies. He has also conducted research on CO2 sequestration and Australian salt lakes.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Raman study of barite and celestine at various temperatures", "year": "2020", "source": "Minerals, vol. 10, no. 3, pp. -", "authors": ["Zhou L", "Terry Mernagh", "Mo B"]}, {"title": "Fluid inclusion systematics in porphyry copper deposits: The super-giant Grasberg deposit, Indonesia, as a case study", "year": "2020", "source": "Ore Geology Reviews, vol. 123, pp. 1-3", "authors": ["Terry Mernagh", "Leys C", "Henley R"]}, {"title": "Tracing metal sources for the giant McArthur River Zn-Pb deposit (Australia) using lead isotopes", "year": "2020", "source": "Geology, vol. 48, no. 5, pp. 478-482", "authors": ["Gigon J", "Deloule E", "Mercadier J", "Terry Mernagh"]}, {"title": "Intrusion related gold deposits in the Tanami and Kurundi-Kurinelli goldfields, Northern Territory, Australia: Constraints from LA-ICPMS analysis of fluid inclusions", "year": "2019", "source": "Ore Geology Reviews, vol. 115, no. 0", "authors": ["Zhou L", "Terry Mernagh", "Lan T"]}, {"title": "Microthermometric evidence for the formation of Permian VHMS deposits in Tasik Chini area, Central Belt of Peninsular Malaysia", "year": "2019", "source": "Ore Geology Reviews, vol. 111, pp. 1-16", "authors": ["Iswadi Basori M", "Zaw K", "Terry Mernagh"]}, {"title": "Significance of high temperature fluids and melts in the Grasberg porphyry copper?gold deposit", "year": "2019", "source": "Chemical Geology, vol. 508, pp. 210-224", "authors": ["Terry Mernagh", "Mavrogenes J"]}, {"title": "Observation of the Chemical Structure of Water up to the Critical Point by Raman Spectroscopic Analysis of Fluid Inclusions", "year": "2019", "source": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B, vol. 123, no. 27, pp. 5841-5847", "authors": ["Zhou L", "Terry Mernagh", "Le Losq C"]}, {"title": "nalytical Techniques for Probing Small-Scale Layers that Preserve Information on Gas-Solid Interactions", "year": "2018", "source": "Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry, vol. 84, pp. 103-175", "authors": ["Dalby K", "Berger J", "Brand H", "Terry Mernagh"]}, {"title": "Gas-Solid Reactions: Theory, Experiments and Case Studies Relevant to Earth and Planetary Processes", "year": "2018", "source": "Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry, vol. 84, no. 1, pp. 1-56", "authors": ["King P", "Wheeler V", "Renggli C", "Terry Mernagh"]}, {"title": "Unravelling the Consequences of SO2-Basalt Reactions for Geochemical Fractionation and Mineral Formation", "year": "2018", "source": "Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry, vol. 84, pp. 257-283", "authors": ["Palm A", "King P", "Renggli C", "Terry Mernagh"]}, {"title": "Using Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy to Analyze Gas-Solid Reactions", "year": "2018", "source": "Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry, vol. 84, no. 1, pp. 177-228", "authors": ["Terry Mernagh", "King P", "McMillan P"]}, {"title": "High temperature gas-solid reactions in calc-silicate Cu-Au skarn formation;
