The compositions of shells and skeletal materials of marine invertebrates are essential archives for quantifying temperatures and environmental conditions before modern climate records began. However, their reliability relies on understanding their formation. Emerging knowledge from material sciences indicates that these biocarbonates form via transient precursors rather than direct precipitation from seawater, profoundly affecting their interpretation. This project plans to transfer this new understanding to the earth sciences using nanoscale analytical methods including in vitro geochemical partitioning experiments. This would enable realistic models for geochemical proxy behaviour to be developed, significantly improving paleoclimate interpretations and assessments of ocean acidification effects on marine calcifiers.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160102081", "id": "664003", "institutions": ["Macquarie University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102081", "researchers": ["Dr Dorrit Jacob", "Prof Stephen Eggins", "Dr Richard Wirth"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 345300, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Macquarie University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102081", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102081", "DP160102081"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664003"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to build a femtosecond-laser, micropyrolysis gas-chromatographmass spectrometer.
