The tool is based on individual quantum coherent spins in diamond which can be manipulated and optically read. The project expects to generate knowledge in quantum metrology and an understanding of molecular dynamics at the nanoscale. The expected outcome is a new type of device capable of imaging complex physical systems at the level of their individual constituent components. This has significant benefits in improving designer materials, energy production, information storage, and drug design.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT180100100", "id": "1343972", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100100", "researchers": ["Dr Liam McGuinness"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 728125, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-02T04:21:12Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100100", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100100", "FT180100100"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1343972"}]}]}
