Parent's time is a resource on which children depend, but time scarcity has become a widespread problem for families. Our study helps focus policy attention on this problem. We deliver new methods to assess the experience of time scarcity in families, identifying those who are most likely to experience it, where they live, and how time scarcity affects them. This evidence can help support policy approaches to time, benefiting the twin economic and social policy goals of encouraging workforce participation while supporting the health and wellbeing of families.", "title": "Time scarcity in Australian families: another inequity?", "id": "66544", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP100100106", "researchers": ["Strazdins Dr Lyndall", "Prof Dorothy H Broom", "Mr John D Glover", "Dr Catherine Banwell", "Dr Jane M Dixon", "Dr Amy L Griffin", "Dr Rosemary Korda", "Miss Megan A Shipley", "Dr Francesco Paolucci", "Dr Marian T Esler", "Dr Stephen J Corbett"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 325000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2010, "endDate": 2013, "dateTimeModified": "2015-08-13T17:18:48Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T02:06:17Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP100100106", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP100100106", "LP100100106"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "family", "health inequity", "time", "wellbeing"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/66544"}]}]}
