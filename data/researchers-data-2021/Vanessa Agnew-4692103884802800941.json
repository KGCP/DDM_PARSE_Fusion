Mellon Foundation and other funding bodies, supports scholars at risk from around the world. The program allows threatened scholars to work in safety and establish themselves academically in Germany. It helps translate their research on behalf of intellectual and academic networks in Germany and abroad, providing wide benefit to the global intellectual community. Furthermore, it pilots new models for supporting threatened academics in exile, gathering scholars into like-minded cohorts for mutual support, focusing collaborative work around the theme of critical thinking, and producing innovative pedagogical tools for providing online educational content. Such tools can be replicated and scaled by other programs and initiatives that assist threatened scholars around the world. AiE provides a forum for reflecting on the pressing challenges to intellectual life, critical thinking, reason, social justice, and diversity that are facing us today."], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "history s affective turn historical reenactment and its work in the present", "year": 2007, "source": "rethinking history", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew"}], "id": 38956679}, {"title": "introduction what is reenactment", "year": 2004, "source": "criticism", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}], "id": 20213736}, {"title": "the routledge handbook of reenactment studies key terms in the field", "year": 2019, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew"}, {"name": "jonathan lamb"}, {"name": "juliane tomann", "affiliation": "vanderbilt university"}]}, {"title": "reenacting the stone age journeying back in time through the uckermark and western pomerania", "year": 2018, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew"}]}, {"title": "enlightenment orpheus the power of music in other worlds", "year": 2008, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew"}]}, {"title": "songs from the edge of the world enlightenment perceptions of khoikhoi and bushmen music", "year": 2013, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew", "affiliation": "max planck society"}]}, {"title": "hearing things music and sounds the traveller heard and didn t hear on the grand tour", "year": 2012, "source": "cultural studies review", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}], "id": 2764866180}, {"title": "epilogue genealogies of space in colonial and postcolonial reenactment", "year": 2009, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}]}, {"title": "settler and creole reenactment", "year": 2009, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew"}, {"name": "jonathan lamb"}, {"name": "daniel spoth"}]}, {"title": "listening to others eighteenth century encounters in polynesia and their reception in german musical thought", "year": 2007, "source": "eighteenth century studies", "authors": [{"name": "vanessa agnew"}], "id": 134335455}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
