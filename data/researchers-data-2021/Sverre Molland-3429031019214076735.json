Safe migration denotes a conceptual shift in policy as it targets migrants moving through space, as opposed to being confined by it. Yet, there has been no independent study into how such emergent policies and programmes are operationalised or the ways in which they affect migrants.", "This is a limited and targeted research project which aims to:", "\u2022 examine the policy and migratory contexts in which the shift from anti-trafficking programs to safe migration program is taking place;", "\u2022 investigate how these changes, framed in policy as \u201csafety\u201d, are operationalised by implementers and experienced by migrants;", "\u2022 advance anthropological theorising of migration governance by examining shifting modes of policy making which places mobility at the centre of the governing of social life;", "\u2022 enrich ethnographic methodological approaches to the study of migration and its governance;", "\u2022 inform future policy responses, including those relating to Australia's role in the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, bilateral funding of migration management in the region, as well as policies on seasonal workers and the 457 visa scheme in Australia.", "Despite the considerable resources devoted to managing labour migration to Australia, the Asia-Pacific Region and beyond, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding policy implementation and its impact on migrants.
