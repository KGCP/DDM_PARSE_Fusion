I emphasise testing and refining ecological theory, while also working closely with conservation practitioners to inform management.I have conducted extensive research on amphibian ecology, and in particular, the impacts of the devastating disease, chytridiomycosis, on the world\u2019s amphibians. My research in this area is aligned with informing the development of effective management strategies to\u00a0prevent population\u00a0declines and species\u00a0extinctions.Where needed, I use a mix of population and landscape ecology to better understand patterns of threat distribution. I also use landscape ecology approaches to investigate the occurrence of wildlife in human-modified landscapes and have conducted research in farmland regions in south-eastern Australia, and the traditional rural landscapes of Transylvania, Romania."], "biography": "", "project": ["I have several projects\u00a0investigating the population ecology of declining amphibians in south-eastern Australia impacted by chytrid fungus; a key global threat to amphibians.
