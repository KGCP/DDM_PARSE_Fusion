It will build upon recent experimental advances by our team that have shown diamond to possess a two-dimensional (2D) hole-based system with strong spin-orbit coupling. As a semiconductor with unique spin properties, surface conducting diamond offers considerable advantages over other 2D materials such as graphene and topological insulators. These unique properties will be exploited to realise novel semiconductor device architectures for the manipulation of spin using electric fields, and for the study of new spin transport phenomena and quasiparticle excitations at semiconductor-superconductor interfaces.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150101673", "id": "617855", "institutions": ["La Trobe University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150101673", "researchers": ["A/Prof Christopher Pakes", "Prof Dr Lothar Ley", "A/Prof Jeffrey McCallum", "Dr Dongchen Qi"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 266300, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:00Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["La Trobe University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150101673", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150101673", "DP150101673"], "subjects": ["NANOTECHNOLOGY", "TECHNOLOGY", "DIAMOND; NANOFABRICATION; QUANTUM TRANSPORT"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617855"}]}, {"description": "This project aims at constructing and observing an individual quantum system that can exhibit chaotic behaviour under controllable conditions.
