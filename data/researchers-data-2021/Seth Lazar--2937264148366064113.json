I have two current research projects.The first focuses on how those who care about rights and duties can make decisions under risk and uncertainty. I\u2019m working on a book, to come out with Oxford University Press, called\u00a0Duty Under Doubt: Deontological Decision-Making with Imperfect Information. This work fits into \u2018Ethics and Risk\u2019, an AUD335,000 grant from the Australian government, held jointly with Katie Steele, Alan Hajek, Frank Jackson, Philip Pettit and Lara Buchak.My second project, which I started in August 2019, is on Humanising Machine Intelligence. I\u2019m project leader of a major AUD7.5m investment by ANU on the morality, law and politics of data and AI. Our goal is to lay the social, theoretical, and technological foundations for democratically legitimate data and AI. I am thrilled to be working with some of the university\u2019s leading computer scientists, philosophers, and social scientists on one of the most important problems of our age. Read about that at\u00a0hmi.anu.edu.au.\u00a0I\u2019m going to be working on a number of topics: philosophical issues raised by the political economy of data and AI; automating governance and governing automation; and how AI amplifies human tendencies, for better or worse. This last topic is part of a just-awarded grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation, part of their \u2018Diverse Intelligences\u2019 initiative, for USD234,000, for which I am Director, Claire Benn is Co-Director, and Jenny Davis, Toni Erskine, Colin Klein, and Bob Williamson are also investigators."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Deontological decision theory and lesser-evil options [IN PRESS]", "year": "2019", "source": "Synthese, vol.
