Other expected outcomes include reliable methods to monitor significant sea-level rise and associated societal and economic disruptions.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190102382", "id": "1378563", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190102382", "researchers": ["Dr Paul Tregoning", "Dr Simon McClusky", "Dr Srinivas Bettadpur"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 485000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:48Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:48Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190102382", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190102382", "DP190102382"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378563"}]}, {"description": "This project will deliver breakthrough science that will strengthen Indonesia's ability to reduce its vulnerability to earthquake disasters.
