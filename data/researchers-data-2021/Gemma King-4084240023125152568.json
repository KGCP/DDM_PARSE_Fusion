I received a 2018 ANU Vice Chancellor's Award for Teaching Excellence and\u00a0a 2020 Citation for Outstanding Contribution to Student Learning from the Australian Awards for University Teaching, and\u00a0taught in French, English and Cinema studies\u00a0at the University of Melbourne, the Universit\u00e9\u00a0Paris 3: Sorbonne Nouvelle and the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil before joining the ANU as a Lecturer in 2016. My work has been published in Contemporary French Civilization, L'Esprit Cr\u00e9ateur, the Australian Journal of French Studies, Francosph\u00e8res, Linguistica Antverpiensia, French Cultural Studies, The Conversation and numerous edited volumes, and I run Les Mus\u00e9es de Paris, a blog about the lesser-known museums of Paris. My first book\u00a0Decentring France: Multilingualism and Power in Contemporary French Cinema\u00a0was published with Manchester University Press in 2017 and my second book,\u00a0Jacques Audiard, is in press\u00a0for Manchester's French Film Directors series.", "project": ["Decentring France: Multilingualism and Power in Contemporary French Cinema\u00a0(Manchester University Press 2017)", "In a world defined by the flow of people, goods, and cultures, many contemporary French films explore the multicultural nature of today\u2019s France through language. From rival\u00a0lingua francas\u00a0such as English to socio-politically marginalised languages such as Arabic or Kurdish, multilingual characters in these films exploit their knowledge of multiple languages, and offer counter-perspectives to dominant ideologies of the role of linguistic diversity in society.\u00a0Decentring France\u00a0is the first substantial study of multilingual film in France. It\u00a0argues that many contemporary French films take a new approach to language and power, showing how even the most historically-maligned languages can empower their speakers. This book offers a unique insight to academics and students alike, into the place of language and power in French cinema today.", "Jacques Audiard, in press with Manchester University Press, French Film Directors series", "This volume of the French Film Directors series is the first book-length project on Jacques Audiard and uses the motif of border-crossing to analyse his oeuvre. Spanning traditional French contexts and transnational spaces, exploring gender and disability alongside language and violence, it defines Audiard as a key figure in contemporary French cinema."], "publication": [{"title": "The Door of No Return: A Cinema of (Up)rooting and Decentring in Rachid Bouchareb", "year": "2020", "source": "s Little Senegal'in Michael Gott, Leslie Kealhofer-Kemp (ed.), ReFocus: The Films of Rachid Bouchareb, Edinburgh University Press Ltd., Edinburgh, pp. 166-180", "authors": ["Gemma King"]}, {"title": "Le m\u00e9tro-maison et l", "year": "2020", "source": "art de la transm\u00e9diation dans L'\u00c9cume des jours : de Vian \u00e0 Gondry' ('The m\u00e9tro-maison and the art of transmediation in L'\u00c9cume des jours: From Vian to Gondry')in Benjamin Andreo, Alistair Rolls, Clara Sitbon, Marie-Laure Vuaille-Barcan (ed.), Boris Vian: L'adaptateur adapt\u00e9, Editions Hermann, Paris, France, pp. 69-88", "authors": ["Gemma King"]}, {"title": "French Studies: Film Studies", "year": "2020", "source": "The Year's Work in Modern Language Studies, vol. 80, no. 1, pp. 261-271", "authors": ["Chaplin F", "Gemma King"]}, {"title": "Translingualism and Race Passing in Samba: On Fantasies of Migrant Identity in Contemporary France", "year": "2019", "source": "Esprit Createur, vol. 59, no. 4, pp. 84-108", "authors": ["Gemma King"]}, {"title": "Denis Villeneuve", "year": "2019", "source": "s Multilingual Cinema: Decentring SpaceTime and Language in Arrival', in Ralf Junkerj\u00fcrgen and Gala Rebane (ed.), Multilingualism in Film, Peter Lang, Berlin, pp. 209-224", "authors": ["Gemma King"]}, {"title": "Multiculturalism Obscured: Paris Museum Cultures and the Mus\u00e9e de l", "year": "2019", "source": "Institut du monde arabe'Australian Journal of French Studies, vol. 56, no. 2, pp. 156-169", "authors": ["Gemma King"]}, {"title": "Introduction: Truth and Representation in French and Francophone Studies", "year": "2019", "source": "Australian Journal of French Studies, vol. 56, no. 2, pp. 117-124", "authors": ["Barnes L", "Collins A", "Gemma King"]}, {"title": "In Spike Lee", "year": "2018", "source": "s BlacKkKlansmanLanguage is Power', The Conversation, September 10", "authors": ["Gemma King"]}, {"title": "No Laughing Matter?
