I take a complex systems approach to studying the resilience of systems of humans and nature, integrating mathematical methods and concepts from my background in theoretical physics with knowledge and approaches from other disciplines. I use these tools in a broad range of intensive interdisciplinary collaborations on topics including water resources, Earth system science, climate change, biodiversity loss, fisheries, poverty and agriculture. My ambition is to become a world leader in research and teaching on the resilience of social-ecological systems and the use of complex systems methods to understand resilience."], "biography": "Researcher at Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University, Sweden", "project": ["Earth Commission - Earth system targets for a safe and just future", "ARC Future Fellowship -\u00a0Advancing resilience theory and practice for water resource management", "The futures of reef services in the Anthropocene (REEF-FUTURES)", "The Economics of Planetary Boundaries", "Science in action: intersecting pathways to the SDGs across scales in the drylands (XPaths)"], "publication": [{"title": "Comment on \"Resilience of Complex Systems: State of the Art and Directions for Future Research\"", "year": "2019", "source": "Complexity, vol. 2019, pp. 4 pages", "authors": ["Steven Lade", "Peterson G"]}, {"title": "Matching scope, purpose and uses of planetary boundaries science", "year": "2019", "source": "Environmental Research Letters, vol. 14, no. 7, pp. 1-11", "authors": ["Downing A", "Bhowmik A", "Collste D", "Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "Capturing emergent phenomena in social-ecological systems: an analytical framework", "year": "2019", "source": "Ecology and Society, vol. 24, no. 3, pp. 1-26", "authors": ["Schl\u00c3\u00bcter M", "Haider L", "Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "nalytically tractable climate\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccarbon cycle feedbacks under 21st century anthropogenic forcing", "year": "2018", "source": "Earth System Dynamics, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 507-523pp", "authors": ["Steven Lade", "Donges J", "Fetzer I"]}, {"title": "Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene", "year": "2018", "source": "PNAS - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 115, no. 33, pp. 8252-8259pp", "authors": ["Steffen W", "Rockstrom J", "Richardson K", "Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "When optimization for governing human environment tipping elements is neither sustainable nor safe", "year": "2018", "source": "Nature Communications, vol. 9, no. 2354, pp. 1-10pp", "authors": ["Barfuss W", "Donges J", "Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "Resilience offers escape from trapped thinking on poverty alleviation", "year": "2017", "source": "Science Advances, vol. 3, no. 5, pp. e1603043-e1603043", "authors": ["Steven Lade", "Haider L", "Engstr\u00c3\u00b6m G"]}, {"title": "Generalized modeling of empirical social-ecological systems", "year": "2017", "source": "Natural Resource Modeling, vol. 30, no. 3, pp. -", "authors": ["Steven Lade", "Niiranen S"]}, {"title": "Multi-level policies and adaptive social networks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a conceptual modeling study for maintaining a polycentric governance system", "year": "2017", "source": "International Journal of the Commons, vol. 11, no. 1, pp. 220-247pp", "authors": ["Mathias J", "Steven Lade", "Galaz V"]}, {"title": "Effectiveness of beads for tracking small-scale molecular motor dynamics", "year": "2011", "source": "Physical Review E-Statistical, Nonlinear and Soft Matter Physics, vol. 84, no. 2, pp. 1-10", "authors": ["Steven Lade", "Craig E", "Linke H"]}, {"title": "Ratchet-based magnetic micropump", "year": "2010", "source": "Europhysics Letters, vol. 92, no. 3, pp. 33001-1/6", "authors": ["Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "Geometric and projection effects in Kramers-Moyal analysis", "year": "2009", "source": "Physical Review E-Statistical, Nonlinear and Soft Matter Physics, vol. 80, no. 031137, p. 6", "authors": ["Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "Finite sampling interval effects in Kramers-Moyal analysis", "year": "2009", "source": "Physics Letters A, vol. 373, pp. 3705-3709", "authors": ["Steven Lade"]}, {"title": "Simplified models for vibrational energy transfer in proteins", "year": "2008", "source": "Physics Letters A, vol. 372, pp. 1077-1080", "authors": ["Steven Lade", "Kivshar Y"]}, {"title": "Ratchets: Directed transport without a bias force", "year": "2008", "source": "National AIP Congress 2008, ed.
