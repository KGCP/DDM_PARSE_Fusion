modelling approach to understand how Antarctic dense water formation changed in past climates and how to predict future changes. The Southern Ocean is critical in the uptake of heat and carbon from the atmosphere into the deep ocean. The sinking of cold and saline dense water around the coast of Antarctica transports heat and carbon into the deep ocean. Climate models fail to simulate this process and little is known about how dense water formation responds to changes in climate. Identification of critical vulnerabilities associated with Antarctic ice shelf melting and sea level rise will guide Southern Ocean observation systems and Australian climate adaptation programs.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE170100184", "id": "942391", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100184", "researchers": ["Dr Adele Morrison"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 360000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:26Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:56Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100184", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100184", "DE170100184"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/942391"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to comprehensively understand the interconnected processes by which oceanic heat is circulated towards Antarctica. The risk of rapid ocean warming at the Antarctic margin is profound, with change already detected via deep ocean warming, land-ice melt, and ice shelf collapse. Yet this region remains poorly understood, with only limited observations due to both a harsh environment and a lack of standard data streams. This project will use high-resolution global and regional ocean/sea-ice models to examine mechanisms for rapid warming of Antarctic continental shelf waters via both large-scale drivers and fine-scale processes, including mesoscale eddies, tide-topography interactions, and bottom boundary flows. This work will better constrain future rates of ice melt around Antarctica by providing vital knowledge of the ocean processes, dynamics, and feedbacks relating to warm water intrusion onto the Antarctic continental shelf.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100494", "id": "1378231", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100494", "researchers": ["Prof Matthew England", "Dr Andrew Hogg", "Dr Adele Morrison", "Dr Paul Spence", "Dr Stephen Griffies"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 582500, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:44Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:44Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100494", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100494", "DP190100494"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378231"}]}]}
