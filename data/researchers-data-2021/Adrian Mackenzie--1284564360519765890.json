My research is sociological in that it\u00a0 draws\u00a0 on approaches from the social studies of science and technology, media and cultural studies,\u00a0 with a particular commitment to studies of software.My current research projects focus on platforms and platform sociology in the context of science and media, on biosensors and biosensing practices in the context of health and illness, and on data science-related transformations in knowledge in the sciences, education and government.My recent work has been concerned with platform capitalisation and machine learning. I examine linkages between platforms and prediction in much of this work, including projects focused on large image collections, and projects focused on platform infrastructures. I am currently working with Anna Munster (UNSW) and Kynan Tan on an ARC Discovery Project 'Re-imaging the Empirical' (2017-2021) that tracks changes in visual cultures of machine learning.IN 2019-2020, I've been working with CSIRO Land & Water and Data61 on platform urbanism.\u00a0 Ashlin Lee, Paul Box, Andrew Rees,\u00a0 Gavin Smith (Sociology, ANU) and I have been mapped several hundred smart city projects, leading to reports and journal articles.I'm excited to be working with Gavin Smith, Celia Roberts, Adrian Manning (Fenner Schoo, ANUl), Sujatha Raman (CPAS, ANU) and Jason Cummings (Woodlands and Wetlands Trust) as well as Mitchell Whitelaw (School of Art and Design, ANU) on biodiversities and Australian urban fringes. We have recruited PhD students to work on the biosocial dynamics of sanctuaries on urban fringes.I'm\u00a0 interested in methodological developments associated with platforms. I view and participate in these developments mainly in the form of digital sociology, but also by continuing work that has long been part of actor network theory-guided approaches in science studies.I have long-standing interests in the social, cultural and political theory, particularly in conceptual developments around materialities, publics, embodiment and experience.\u00a0\u00a0Some of my research has been published as books.Mackenzie, A.
