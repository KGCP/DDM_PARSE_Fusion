Very little work has been done on this subject in General Practice in any other country, and Australia is the only country with previous research that has attempted to describe GP errors with the Quality in Australia Health Care Study (QAHCS). However, we have so far not had any research that has been done on a representative sample of GPs, or been able to quantify the frequency with which different types of errors occur. This study plans to ask a representative sample of GPs in both urban and rural areas to report their errors, so that we can try to quantify the incidence and prevalence of these different error types. No previous work has been done in Primary care which has attempted to determine the rate of recognized errors that occur in the community. In addition, since the last major work on this topic was done between 1993 and 1998, there have been many changes to General Practice, especially in the area of computerisation, and the types of problems that GPs face now may have changed significantly. Anonymous reporting is very important in order to encourage health professionals to admit to their mistakes, and in the past, projects have used paper based reporting forms, making it difficult to offer anonymity and requiring protection for participants under a Commonwealth Act of Parliament. However the GPES project will be the first major study of General Practice errors that uses an on-line anonymous reporting form, and high level encryption, located on a secure web-site, to encourage honest reporting. The reporting form was trialled in the 2001 pilot study. By analysing the types of errors occurring, and their contributing factors, we can target at-risk population groups and develop strategies to improve patient care and prevent future harm.", "title": "Primary Health Care Errors Study: Qualification and quantification of errors occurring in General Practice", "id": "82087", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/253653", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Kidd", "Dr Chris Cooper", "Prof Michael Mira", "A/Pr Meredith Makeham"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 191000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:06Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:23Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Michael Kidd"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/253653", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/253653", "253653"], "subjects": ["321208", "Development of a classification system for errors", "General Practice", "Health policy recommendations", "Measurement of errors", "Primary Health Care", "Errors occurring in General Practice affecting patient care", "Policy recommendations to minimise errors in primary care", "Prevention of errors in General Practice"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82087"}]}, {"description": "The number of people living with HIV-AIDS in Australia is increasing and ageing, requiring an expert primary care workforce to provide HIV clinical care into the future.
