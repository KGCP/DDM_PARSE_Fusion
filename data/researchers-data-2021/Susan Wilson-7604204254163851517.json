A most unknown subset of these parts work together in molecular pathways that underpin susceptibility and resistance to Type 1 diabetes and its complications. The MAPDB study will link patients, families, doctors, genome experts, immunologists, physiologists, statisticians and data base programmers together to illuminate these molecular pathways. In particular, the study will reveal genes and pathways that medicate protection from diabetes and its complications - either by inhibiting T cell responses to pancreatic beta cells, protecting or regenerating beta cells in the face of metabolic or immunologic stress, or protecting eyes and kidneys from the damaging effects of high blood glucose. By identifying genes and proteins with these functions, the study will enable new treatments to be developed aimed at augmenting these protective pathways, to prevent diabetes starting in children at risk, and to preserve beta cell mass, protect transplanted stem cells or beta cells, and prevent eye and kidney damage in people already affected by Type 1 diabetes. Genes and proteins that are needed for T cell attack on beta cells will also be revealed. This information will enable new treatments to be developed that block these processes, to prevent diabetes from starting, to preserve beta cell mass and to prevent destruction of transplanted stem cells or beta cells. The MAPDB study will also identify different versions-alleles- of many of the genes in the pathways described above. Particular combinations of these gene alleles will be defines that can identify people at high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes, risk of cell or islet transplantation rejection, or at most risk for eye-kidney complications. Different gene combinations may be found that allow different kinds of Type 1 diabetes to distinguished. By creating ways to identify and distinguish people's individual risk, the study will yield diagnostic tests to enable new treatments and clinical trials to be targeted.", "title": "Molecular analysis of pathways in diabetes (MAPDB) study", "id": "81602", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219167", "researchers": ["Prof Peter Colman", "Prof Grant Morahan", "Dr Keats Nelms", "Prof Simon Easteal", "Prof Susan Wilson", "Prof Gavin Huttley", "Prof Christopher Goodnow", "Prof Paul Hertzog"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 3348000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:44Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:09Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Christopher Goodnow"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219167", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219167", "219167"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "Type 1 diabetes", "autoimmunity", "diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy", "functional genomics", "genes"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/81602"}]}]}
