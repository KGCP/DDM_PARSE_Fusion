However, current model-based controllers amplify the calibration effort and increase development costs as the tuning parameters are not related to time domain specifications. The anticipated outcome is new model based control architectures that improve diesel engine operation and reduce its calibration effort and cost.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP160100650", "id": "941983", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100650", "researchers": ["Prof Chris Manzie", "Dr Iman Shames", "Prof Dragan Nesic", "Dr Hayato Nakada"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 410000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:54Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100650", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100650", "LP160100650"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/941983"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop models, design and analysis techniques for secure Networked Control Systems (NCS).
