in Australia occurs in general practice. Australian general practice will therefore have a critical role to play in control efforts during an influenza pandemic, and also in sustaining other primary health care activities. After an initial surge in attendances, there may be a decline in attendance, as Australians become more reluctant to congregate in a place where they may become ill. This study seeks to complement the Australian Pandemic Influenza Management Plan by developing a range of action plans for use by general practitioners and public health authorities to support essential primary health care functions through a pandemic, and maximize general practice's contribution to control efforts. A range of methods will be used, including systematic review of existing literature, economic modeling of the Medicare costs and savings of different models of health care, interviews with key informants who have helped develop disaster response plans for general practice, or who are in positions of leadership. The project will culminate in the development of a simulation exercise to be used as a self-assessment tool for general practitioners, and a summit of general practice stakeholders who will help to finalise agreed action plans for the general practice response to pandemic influenza.", "title": "Strenthening the contribution of Australian general practice to the control of pandemic influenza", "id": "95025", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410228", "researchers": ["Prof Nicholas Glasgow", "A/Pr Christine Phillips", "A/Pr Paul Dugdale", "Dr Mohamed Patel", "Prof Marjan Kljakovic"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 110257, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:28Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Marjan Kljakovic"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410228", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410228", "410228"], "subjects": ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Community Health", "General practice", "Keywords", "Public health policy"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95025"}]}, {"description": "Genital chlamydia infection is the most commonly reported infectious disease in Australia. Notifications have increased three fold since 1995; five-fold in the ACT and surveillance data underestimate the true incidence of the disease in the community. Chlamydia is associated with immediate morbidity in men and women including urethritis, epididymo-orchitis, cervicitis, and pelvic pain and long-term complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility. The economic costs of Chlamydial infection in Australia have been estimated to be as high as $160 million each year. In the ACT 73.8% of chlamydial infections occur in the 20-40 year old group. Between 60 and 70% of women in this age range participate in Pap screening every two years. While targeted screening for Chlamydia in women is effective in the US, there are few studies that investigate its value in an Australian setting. In this randomised controlled clinical trial we aim to test the novel hypothesis that the routine offer of chlamydia testing to women between 20 and 40 years who undergo Pap screening significantly increases the detection of Chlamydia in that population. This is the first randomised-controlled trial of its type and is an extension of a current non-randomised pilot study of linked Chlamydia-Pap screening in the primary care setting. The aim is to determine if the program can be incorporated more widely in the ACT. The study will: Measure the impact of linked chlamydia-Pap screening on chlamydia screening participation rates More accurately determine the epidemiology of genital chlamydial infection in this age group and social setting; Undertake an economic evaluation of this approach; Determine if promoting the Pap smear as an opportunity for chlamydial screening increases the uptake of Pap screening in younger women Aid in the development of a National Chlamydia Screening strategy", "title": "Screening for Chlamydia trachomatis with routine Pap smears in general practice: A randomised controlled trial", "id": "76890", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268058", "researchers": ["A/Pr Marian Currie", "Prof Nicholas Glasgow", "Dr Lynette Lim", "Prof Francis Bowden", "Dr James Butler", "Helen Toyne"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 350500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:15Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:35Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Francis Bowden"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268058", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268058", "268058"], "subjects": ["321030", "Epidemiology", "Health economics", "Primary care", "Reproductive health", "Screening", "Barriers to screening for sexually transmitted infections", "Cervical cancer screening", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Sexually transmitted infections"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76890"}]}, {"description": "Chronic cough is a common presenting symptom to doctors.

The total health system costs of asthma are estimated to be in excess of $600 million (2). Recently, feather pillows have been shown to have more than five times less house dust mite allergen than other pillows. To date, several population-based studies have shown that children using feather upper bedding are also reported by their parents to have less severe wheeze. These findings call into question the National Asthma Council recommendation that people with asthma who are allergic to house dust mite should use synthetic quilts rather than feather or down (3). However, concerns remain that these important findings may only have occurred because unmeasured factors, such as the socioeconomic status or child diet may be closely related to feather bedding use, and in themselves, protective against asthma. Alternatively, parents of a child with asthma symptoms may be more likely to have chosen non-feather bedding. The best way to address these concerns is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether the use of new feather upper bedding is associated with reduced asthma severity among house dust mite-sensitised children with severe asthma. This study is underway and has support in 2001-2002 from the Financial Markets Foundation for Children.
