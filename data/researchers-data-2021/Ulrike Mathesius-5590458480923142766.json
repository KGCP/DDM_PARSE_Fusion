Once released at the synapse - the contact site between nerve cells - neurotransmitters propagate signals to neighbouring neurons. To allow fast and accurate signal processing in the brain neurotransmitters must be removed rapidly from the site of action. This resets the signal transduction process so that the next nerve impuls can be transmitted. Removal of neurotransmitters is accomplished by transporters, which capture the neurotransmitters and bring them back into neurons and astrocytes, the two major cell types in the brain. Malfunction of these transporters can cause mood disorders, Parkinsons's disease and may play a role in the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders. In this project we try to identify novel neurotransmitters transporters, which are likely to play an important role in neurotransmission. Previously, these transporters were assigned as orphan transporters to indicate our lack of understanding. However, recent results from our laboratory now allows to identify the function of these transporters.
