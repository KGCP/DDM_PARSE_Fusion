research. In some of the social sciences women make up less than 15% of the professoriate. Yet these are the disciplines that should most aid our understanding of how gender works in society. The project asks what impact women&rsquo;s limited influence and status in these key fields of research has upon our capacity to grapple with the social and political changes necessary for progress toward gender equality. In doing so, it builds persuasive arguments about how and why gender matters in the social sciences.
