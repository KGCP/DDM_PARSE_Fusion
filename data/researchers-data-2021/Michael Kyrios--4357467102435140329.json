Both tend to appear in early adulthood and have a number of important similarities. These include problems with planning and organising thoughts, abnormal brain chemistry, and changed function in the same brain region, the anterior cingulate. The anterior cingulate has been known for some time to be involved in emotion, motivation and attention. However, it is now recognised as the interface between the emotional, feeling part of the brain and the controlling, thinking part. Many, if not all, of the functions performed by the anterior cingulate are disturbed in both schizophrenia and OCD, meaning that studying this region may provide important clues to the nature of the two illnesses. One important characteristic of the anterior cingulate which has not been considered in previous research is its division into three distinct subregions, each with their own specific function. In particular, there is a cognitive region, which deals with response selection and information processing, and an emotional region, which assesses motivational content and controls emotional learning. Because of the nature of the two disorders we intend to study, we believe that schizophrenia will be associated with more abnormalities of the cognitive region, while OCD will be associated with changes in the emotional region. Another important feature of our research design is that we intend to collect data from the same subjects using four separate brain imaging techniques, which provide information about different levels of brain structure and function. This will allow us to interpret our findings from measures of brain chemistry in the context of our findings of brain function. Hopefully this will help us to clarify the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and OCD, and provide potential ways to assess the effect of different treatment strategies in these illnesses.", "title": "Relationship between anterior cingulate morphology, neuronal integrity and function in schizophrenia and OCD", "id": "77773", "institutions": ["Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236175", "researchers": ["Dr Robert Wellard", "Dr Mary Phillips", "Prof Christos Pantelis", "Prof Michael Kyrios", "Prof Murat Yucel", "Prof Stephen Wood"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 312813.5, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:57Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:43:03Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Murat Yucel"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236175", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236175", "236175"], "subjects": ["321021", "brain", "cingulate", "function", "morphology", "structure", "neurodevelopment", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "psychiatry", "risk-factors", "schizophrenia"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/77773"}]}, {"description": "Depression is the single largest cause of disability for people in Australia.

In this application, we request funding to continue to follow participants. diamond 2 aims to explore the patient characteristics and health service use patterns of patients who experience persistent major depression with patients who experience a single episode of depression within a 3-year period. We will use the data gathered to develop models that predict recovery-relapse-persistence of depression. Such models will enable us to develop guidelines and design interventions that better target those at risk of continuing and disabling illness.
