We test predictions from general theory that can be widely applied across species: Is the elaboration of sexual signals constrained by predation or by trade-offs with investment in other fitness-enhancing traits? Do females prefer older males, and - if so - why? Are males more variable than females in their morphology and\u00a0behaviour? Why do animals have a bias towards being left or right sided? And so on... We tend to ask a question and then pick a study animal that can answer it.\u00a0Practically speaking, our empirical research usually involves detailed observation of animal behaviour in the laboratory and, less so (unfortunately), in the field. Most of the work is experimental because of the need to determine causality, but we also try to collect data on phenotypic correlations between traits of interest. Together these data provide a more complete picture. For example, an experiment may show that courting is a costly act, but one would still like to know whether males that court more live longer. Both pieces of information are essential. The touted superiority of experimental approaches in behavioural ecology depends on the credibility of the manipulation. In my view, many experiments do not demonstrate what they purport to show if the animal's perception disagrees with the way in which the experimenter describes it. For example, many manipulations of 'confidence of paternity' or 'perceived sex ratio' are potentially flawed.I have a long standing interest in meta-analysis. Meta-analytic techniques attempt to quantitatively review a field of study using custom-designed statistics. It\u00a0is no longer controversial in ecology and evolution, and continues to gain\u00a0supporters. There are many great questions that can be tackled using existing data and meta-analysis. Recent ones we have asked are: Do sexy males sire more sons? Is the academic performance of females less variable than that of males?Finally, I also collaborate with colleagues, notably Hanna Kokko, Lutz Fromhage and Jussi Lehtonen, in developing/explaining sexual selection theory."], "biography": "I grew up in South Africa. My MSc was on sperm competition in frogs, which involved\u00a0designing a frog condom (yes, a plastic bag works). I was then lucky to get funding for a PhD at Oxford University. I studied\u00a0sexual selection in a range of animals and plants, which\u00a0gave me a wide range of experience, but no technical or taxonomic specialty. In early 1996, Patricia Backwell and I headed off to Panama\u00a0(Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute). I learned the pleasures of sundowners, how to fall off a motorbike, travelled to Barbados and Trinidad, and discovered the virtue of wearing boxer shorts\u00a0when living in the tropics. In late 1997 my unemployment ended when I received a STRI Fellowship. I continued my tradition of working on new taxa: parental care and mate desertion in cichlids and life history evolution in a live-bearing fish. I arrived in Australia in 2001. Here I have worked on crickets, beetles, meta-analyses, publication bias,\u00a0and occasionally helped with fieldwork on fiddler crabs. The current main study animal in our lab is the mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. Think of a colourful tropical freshwater fish. Now remove all the colour - that's Gambusia! On the other hand, they mate a lot and\u00a0they are very active which makes them ideal for behavioural studies.

differences in water temperature (such as&nbsp;Tasmania versus Queensland). To what extent has natural selection (for survival) and sexual selection (the ability of males to acquire mates and/or females to resist unwanted matings) driven the local adaptation of populations? Many species have traits that evolve under intense sexual conflict &ndash; notably when males harass or coerce females into mating and females resist these attempts. It is assumed that sexual conflict traits are rarely affected by the local environment. The project will test the hypothesis that temperature can actually drive the evolution of such traits, specifically coercion and resistance to mating.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160100285", "id": "663763", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100285", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Jennions"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 379400, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:33Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100285", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100285", "DP160100285"], "subjects": ["ECOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663763"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to investigate health-related topics in invasive fish.
