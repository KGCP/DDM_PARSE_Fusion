And I have been in the forefront of expanding the field\u2019s objects of study to encompass music, art, and popular culture. These interdisciplinary connections offer new imagination and insights into our thinking about law and justice.Through this framework I have researched in a very wide variety of areas, including drug policy, music history, children\u2019s literature, popular culture, animals, the \u2018war on terror,\u2019 tort law, refugees, and Indigenous peoples; and my theoretical work including articles on Derrida, Bourdieu, Butler, Foucault, Levinas, and Bakhtin has contributed to legal and social theory, legal education, aesthetics, ethical philosophy and legal history.\u00a0 My research uses detailed interdisciplinary case studies that often bring together surprising elements\u2014a story, a legal problem, and a theoretical perspective, for example\u2014in order to show how each facet illuminates the others. This scholarship has been pioneering both in its influence and in its restlessness. Yet beneath its diversity my work has consistently built new bridges and opened new dialogues in three dimensions: across disciplines; between critical theory and law; and with the wider community.My current research interests include Bakhtin and Bourdieu, legal history and modernism in the early twentieth century (particularly through the work of DH Lawrence and Carl Schmitt), the rule of law, and the relationship between art and concepts of law and justice.\u00a0 My\u00a0principal research project is The Sight of Justice: Art and\u00a0the Rule of Law (see below)."], "biography": "Professor Desmond Manderson is an international leader in interdisciplinary scholarship in law and the humanities. He is the author of several books including\u00a0From Mr Sin to Mr Big (1993);\u00a0Songs Without Music: Aesthetic dimensions of law and justice\u00a0(2000); Proximity, Levinas, and the Soul of Law (2006); and Kangaroo Courts and the Rule of Law\u2014The legacy of modernism (2012). His work has led to essays, books, and lectures around the world in the fields of English literature, philosophy, ethics, history, cultural studies, music, human geography, and anthropology, as well as in law and legal theory. Throughout this work Manderson has articulated a vision in which law's connection to these humanist disciplines is critical to its functioning, its justice, and its social relevance. After ten years at McGill University in Montreal, where he held the Canada Research Chair in Law and Discourse, and was founding Director of the Institute for the Public Life of Arts and Ideas, he returned to Australia to take up a Future Fellowship in the colleges of law and the humanities at ANU.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "The Confessor: Oprah Winfrey, James Frey and the Spectacular Logic of Contemporary Confession", "year": "2018", "source": "in Timothy D Peters and Karen Crawley (ed.), Envisioning Legality: Law, Culture and Representation, Routledge, London, London United Kingdom, pp. 161-180", "authors": ["Crawley K", "Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "Law and the visual: representations", "year": "2018", "source": "technologies and critiqueUniversity of Toronto Press, Candada", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson", "ed"]}, {"title": "Introduction: Imaginal Law", "year": "2018", "source": "in Desmond Manderson (ed.), Law and the Visual: representations, technologies and critique, University of Toronto Press, Candada, pp. 3-20", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "Blindness Visible: Law, Time, and Bruegel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justice", "year": "2018", "source": "in Desmond Manderson (ed.), Law and the Visual: representations, technologies and critique, University of Toronto Press, Candada, pp. 23-50", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "Here and Now: From \"Aestheticizing Politics\" to \"Politicizing Art\"", "year": "2018", "source": "in Mark Antaki, Stefan Huygenbaert, Angela Condello, Sarah Marusek (ed.), Sensing the Nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Law: Historical Inquiries into the Aesthetics of Democratic Legitimacy, Springer International Publishing, New York USA, pp. 175-190", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "Chronotopes in the scopic regime of sovereignty", "year": "2017", "source": "Visual Studies, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 167-177", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "Klimt", "year": "2016", "source": "s Jurisprudence - Homo Sacer and the Body'Pollen (Creaturely Life), vol. 2, pp. 29-32pp", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "Justice and Art, Face to Face", "year": "2016", "source": "Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 241-263", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson", "Martinez C"]}, {"title": "Here and Now: From", "year": "2016", "source": "Aestheticizing Politics' to Politicizing Art''No foundations: an interdisciplinary journal of law and justice, vol. 13, pp. 1-16", "authors": ["Desmond Manderson"]}, {"title": "The Other 1215", "year": "2016", "source": "Magna Carta 800 Symposium, ed.
