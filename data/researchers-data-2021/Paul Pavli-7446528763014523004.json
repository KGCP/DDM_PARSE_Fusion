facing contemporary gastroenterology is to understand the causes of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Studies on the prevalence, incidence and cost of IBD indicate that these diseases have considerable impact in Australia. On average, patients lose more than 13 days from work each year, and in hospital, IBD in-patients accounted for 7% of total admissions and 10% of total bed days at an average cost of $2600 per admission. We estimate that there may be more than 10,000 Australians who suffer from IBD. The existence of a genetic predisposition to IBD is now well established, and there is strong evidence that the disease is complex, resulting from the interaction of a number of different genes. To date, one genetic localisation on chromosome 16 has been established in several different populations, and we have confirmed the importance of this localisation in the Australian population. We will further refine the localisation by fine scale mapping in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16 by identifying and studying the inheritance of novel markers in the region. We will then identify and characterise the gene itself using several complementary appoaches that rely on differences at the molecular level between disease and normal tissue. This work is part of the international effort to identify all IBD susceptibility genes. Once that is achieved, approaches to explaining the interactions between the genes, their protein products and environmental triggers can be determined. Only when the mechanisms of these interactions are understood will the expectation of rational therapies based on an understanding of disease aetiology be possible.", "title": "Fine scale mapping and identification of the IBD1 gene on chromsosome 16", "id": "95738", "institutions": ["Canberra Hospital"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/151300", "researchers": ["A/Pr Juleen Cavanaugh", "Prof Paul Pavli"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 483849.25, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:17Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:00Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Canberra Hospital"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Juleen Cavanaugh"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/151300", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/151300", "151300"], "subjects": ["270299", "candidate gene analysis", "crohn's disease", "microsatellite analysis", "nonparametric linkage analysis", "positional cloning", "complex disease", "inflammatory bowel disease", "inherited disorders"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95738"}]}]}
