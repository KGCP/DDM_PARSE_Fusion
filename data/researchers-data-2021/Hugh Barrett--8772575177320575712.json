Associated with the state of obesity are elevated levels of blood fats and thus an increased risk for heart disease. Fats in the blood originate from dietary sources and from synthesis by the liver. In obesity, the secretion of blood fats, or lipoproteins, is elevated compared with non-obese individuals. In addition, the mechanisms responsible for the clearance of these fats from the blood are impaired resulting in elevated levels of fat circulating in the body. A particular protein, called apolipoprotein CIII, plays an important role in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism. Obese subjects have elevated levels of this apoprotein and we have hypothesised that this is responsible for the impaired lipoprotein clearance observed in these subjects. In general, obese subjects are insulin resistant, although they may not be frank diabetics. Blood insulin levels regulate apolipoprotein CIII concentrations, however, in a state of insulin resistance, as seen in obese subjects, apolipoprotein CIII levels are elevated resulting in high blood fat levels. The focus of this research project is to determine if the level and production of apolipoprotein CIII is elevated in obese subjects compared with non-obese individuals by performing metabolic studies. In addition, we will investigate the effect of statins and fish oil, regulators of cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis respectively, on apolipoprotein CIII levels to assess the association between this and the clearance time of blood fats. If our hypothesis is correct, these studies will demonstrate a new mechanism of action of the statins and fish oil that will aid in the treatment of elevated blood fats and thus reduce the risk for heart disease in this important target population.", "title": "Role of apoCIII in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism in obesity", "id": "99820", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211919", "researchers": ["Prof Hugh Barrett", "Prof Gerald Watts", "Prof Trevor Redgrave"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 240320, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:40Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:56:33Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Hugh Barrett"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211919", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211919", "211919"], "subjects": ["320303", "Insulin resistance", "Lipid metabolism", "Lipoproteins", "Mathematical modelling", "Obesity", "Atherosclerosis", "Cardiovascular disease", "Obesity/Metabolism"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/99820"}]}, {"description": "The incidence of obesity and diabetes is increasing in Australia.

A protein, known as apolipoprotein (apo) B, plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism. Elevated levels of apoB are characteristic of many forms of hypercholestrolaemia. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia and polygenic hypercholesterolaemia are two common inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism that are characterised by elevated apoB levels in the blood and early atherosclerosis. In contrast, familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is a rare inherited disorder of lipoprotein metabolism characterised by very low levels of cholesterol and apoB in the blood and resistance to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The focus of this research project is to explore the regulation of apoB metabolism using individuals from unique families with familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia. First, we will determine and characterise the alterations in the APOB gene causing the low cholesterol levels in families with familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia. Second, we will determine if these apoB alterations affect the production and-or clearance of blood fats, or lipoproteins in affected individuals, when compared to controls, by performing metabolic studies. The proposed human in vivo metabolic studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism(s) involved in the assembly, secretion, transport, and clearance of plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins. Furthermore, these studies may reveal new protective mechanisms and potentially aid in the development of strategies to suppress over-production of apoB-containing lipoproteins in reciprocal conditions such as familial combined hyperlipidaemia or polygenic hypercholesterolaemia.", "title": "Lipoprotein metabolism and mutations of the APOB gene causing familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia", "id": "96103", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403908", "researchers": ["Prof Hugh Barrett", "Prof Frank Van Bockxmeer", "Prof John Burnett"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 396179.34, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:20Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:14Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof John Burnett"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403908", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403908", "403908"], "subjects": ["Medical Biochemistry: Lipids", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND METABOLOMICS", "Genetic disease", "Lipid metabolism", "Lipoproteins", "Mathematical modelling", "Molecular mechanisms", "Atherosclerosis", "Blood lipid metabolism", "Family studies", "Lipid disorders"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96103"}]}, {"description": "Obesity is an increasing problem in Australia.
