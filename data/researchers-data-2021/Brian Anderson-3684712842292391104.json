Formations of unmanned airborne vehicles are currently used by defence forces and swarms of micro-vehicles are beginning to find increasing use in defence and for civilian emergency response, largely for surveillance purposes. Vehicles must cooperate to achieve a global formation objective, while respecting constraints on sensors, energy, and general mechanical limitations. The project aims to resolve the challenges of deciding what a single vehicle should observe, what and to where it should communicate, and how it should move in relation to what it sees. The conceptual framework developed may also be relevant in guiding future defence acquisitions and civilian applications.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160104500", "id": "664305", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160104500", "researchers": ["Dr Changbin Yu", "Prof Brian Anderson"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 455000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160104500", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160104500", "DP160104500"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664305"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to address the challenge of networked systems in deploying teams of robotic agents. Control of the networked system is extremely difficult due to real world constraints imposed on each agent. This project will focus on motion constraints, equipment/capability constraints, and spatial constraints. In addition to theoretical advances, the wider scientific community will benefit directly, because the control algorithms developed are expected to allow straightforward deployment of robotic teams. There are myriad applications for cooperative robotic agents, ranging from surveillance, to environmental monitoring using underwater and aerial drone formations &ndash; with an array of benefits and impacts including economic, commercial and societal.

Lasers and magnetic fields can be used to cool tiny samples of millions of atoms to temperatures a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero. At such cold temperatures they form a superfluid known as a Bose&ndash;Einstein condensate, which flows with zero viscosity. Using tailored light fields to trap and guide the atoms, this project plans to build rudimentary atomic circuits and coax the superfluid to flow through a channel between two reservoirs, firstly with thermodynamic gradients, and secondly by building a quantum pump. Together with computer modelling, this would allow us to characterise the microscopic transport properties of superfluids and provide us with an understanding of how to use them in atomtronic devices in the future.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160102085", "id": "664004", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102085", "researchers": ["Prof Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop", "Dr Tyler Neely", "Prof Matthew Davis", "A/Prof Brian Anderson", "Dr Ashton Bradley"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 406700, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102085", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102085", "DP160102085"], "subjects": ["QUANTUM PHYSICS", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664004"}]}]}
