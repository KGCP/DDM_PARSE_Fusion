Although extensively studied, the geochemical variations recorded in hotspot lavas have, so far, proved difficult to understand, particularly how they relate to their heterogeneous deep-mantle source. In this project, state-of-the-art geodynamical models will be used to determine: (i) how deep-mantle heterogeneities are transported into a plume; and (ii) how such heterogeneities are mixed during plume ascent. This will allow us to link, for the first time, geochemical variations at volcanic hotspots to the deep-mantle's thermo-chemical structure, under an Earth-like, fluid-dynamical framework.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT140101262", "id": "618438", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140101262", "researchers": ["Dr Rhodri Davies"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 683700, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:55Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140101262", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140101262", "FT140101262"], "subjects": ["GEOPHYSICS", "EARTH SCIENCES", "MANTLE DYNAMICS; MANTLE GEOCHEMISTRY; MANTLE PLUMES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618438"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to understand the mechanisms underpinning intra-plate volcanism.
