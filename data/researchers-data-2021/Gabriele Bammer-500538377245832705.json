The level of harms associated with excessive use of these drugs, such as mental health problems and drug dependence, has also increased, as has the use of these drugs via injection. These increases in the prevalence of use and related harms have also been detected internationally. Previous research on psychostimulant drugs, in Australia and overseas, has suggested that using these drugs in particular ways might be associated with a greater chance of contracting HIV and other blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis C (eg through sharing needles and syringes or other equipment associated with injecting drugs); sexually transmitted infections and other sexual health problems (eg through engaging in unsafe sex); and of being involved in violent incidents. Despite this previous research, however, little is known about the specific social and cultural contexts associated with psychostimulant-related harms, and this has stymied the development of appropriate responses to prevent such harms occurring. This research project will provide a greater understanding of the individual, social and cultural factors associated with pychostimulant-related harm through an innovative combination and integration of anthropological and epidemiological research methods known as 'ethno-epidemiology'. In order to access a range of psychostimulant-using contexts, research will focus on three sites: street-based drug users in Sydney, club drug users in Melbourne, and home-based recreational drug users in Perth. These groups have been chosen because they have high prevalences of psychostimulant use. The research project will provide important data that will inform future interventions, improve multidisciplinary models for drug research, and build Australia's capacity to conduct cutting-edge public health research.", "title": "Improving understanding of psychostimulant-related harms in Australia: An integrated ethno-epidemiological approach", "id": "97101", "institutions": ["Curtin University of Technology"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/323212", "researchers": ["Dr Michael Clatts", "Prof Lisa Maher", "Prof Paul Dietze", "Prof Gabriele Bammer", "Prof David Moore"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 612430, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:50:06Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:44:53Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Curtin University of Technology"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof David Moore"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/323212", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/323212", "323212"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "epidemiology", "ethnography", "injecting drug use", "public health", "sexual health", "blood borne communicable diseases", "risk contexts", "young people"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97101"}]}, {"description": "This project will develop methods by which research in population health can be better used by policy makers.

This prestigious award is made in recognition of the international reputation of Australian researchers who were at the time working overseas to be taken up on return to Australia to undertake research. This grant will help position Australia in a newly emerging priority area of research, both nationally and internationally, by offering innovative and structured research skills mentoring for seven early career researchers within a well-funded cutting edge research environment. The group operates with established links to biomedical, clinical, social research and health policy researchers and health policy and clinical service delivery programs and will provide an emphasis on policy relevant research.", "title": "Environmen and population health: research development from local to global", "id": "113311", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224215", "researchers": ["Prof Anne-Louise Ponsonby", "Dorothy Broom", "Prof Niels Becker", "Dr James Butler", "Prof Keith Dear", "Prof Gabriele Bammer", "Prof Anthony Mcmichael", "E/Pr Tord Kjellstrom"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 2472500, "fundingScheme": "Capacity", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:49Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:25:34Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Anthony Mcmichael"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224215", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224215", "224215"], "subjects": ["321201", "Environmental influences on health", "epidemiology and biostatistics", "natural, urban and social environments", "social sciences and economics", "transmission of infectious diseases"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/113311"}]}, {"description": "Depending on how it is done, trade can be good or bad for peoples' health and social well-being.
