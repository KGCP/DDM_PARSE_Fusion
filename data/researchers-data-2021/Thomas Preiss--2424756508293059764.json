He joined the translational control field in 1995 as a postdoctoral scientist and has since had a particular focus on mechanisms of translation initiation using yeast and mammalian cells and cell-free translation systems as his preferred models. In addition to his mechanistic work, he also studies global patterns of post-transcriptional control using microarray and next gen sequencing-based methods. After starting his own group he continued to investigate the role of the mRNA cap and poly(A) tail and associated protein factors in determining mRNA utilisation. These studies overlap with work on the discovery of miRNA targets and the unravelling of their mechanism of action. Employing next gen sequencing technology (RNAseq) his group is further pursuing interests in the area of RNA (mRNA, miRNA, tRNA, other noncoding RNA) processing, modification, polyadenylation and utilisation."], "biography": "", "project": ["1. microRNAs are gene regulators with critical roles in heart disease. We focus on how interactions between microRNAs and their messenger RNA targets  change during disease with a particualr emphasis on analysing the contribution of processing of microRNAs  and targets.", "2. The research successes of Molecular Biology and  Biochemistry have given us detailed pictures of the regulatory and  metabolic states of cells and tissues, yet we know little about how  these states affect each other. We use next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry to investigate the possible existence of regulatory  interactions between ribonucleic acids, enzymes and metabolites to  connect gene expression and metabolism.", "3. The role of the  modified base 5-methylcytosine (m5C) as an epigenetic mark in DNA is  well appreciated and intensely studied. By comparison, the cellular  functions of the same base modification in RNA molecules are poorly understood. We are applying NGS technology to chart the  occurrence of m5C in eukaryotic cellular RNAs and endeavour to unravel  its function(s) for different classes of RNA.", "4. Messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) act as templates for protein synthesis by ribosomes. Much like the DNA of genes, eukaryotic mRNA molecules do not exist as \u2018naked\u2019 nucleic acid. They interact with RNA-binding proteins, ribosomes and translation factors, and adopt dynamic structures that determine the precise outcome of translation. We combine NGS technology with isolation of polyribosomal complexes from living cells, to generate transcriptome-wide snapshots of the distribution of translation complexes along mRNAs. Such systems-level data will allow unprecedented insight into the mechanism, dynamics and regulation of protein synthesis."], "publication": [{"title": "Selective Translation Complex Profiling Reveals Staged Initiation and Co-translational Assembly of Initiation Factor Complexes", "year": "2020", "source": "Molecular Cell, vol. 79, no. 4, pp. 546-560", "authors": ["Wagner S", "Herrmannov\u00e1 A", "Hronov\u00e1 V", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Control of Translation at the Initiation Phase During Glucose Starvation in Yeast", "year": "2019", "source": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences, vol. 20, no. 16, pp. 4043", "authors": ["Janapala Y", "Thomas Preiss", "Shirokikh N"]}, {"title": "Insights into the biogenesis and potential functions of exonic circular RNA", "year": "2019", "source": "Scientific Reports, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 2048", "authors": ["Ragan PhD C", "Goodall G", "Shirokikh N", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Migration of Small Ribosomal Subunits on the 5", "year": "2019", "source": "Untranslated Regions of Capped Messenger RNA'International Journal of Molecular Sciences, vol. 20, no. 18. pp. 446", "authors": ["Shirokikh N", "Dutikova Y", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Regulating RNA Research and CRISPR Gene Drives to Combat Biosecurity Threats", "year": "2018", "source": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3030298", "authors": ["Faunce T", "Ray A", "Gardiner C", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "brave new world of RNA-binding proteins", "year": "2018", "source": "Nature Reviews: Molecular Cell Biology, vol. 19, no. 5, pp. 327-341", "authors": ["Hentze MW Castello A", "Schwarzl T", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Editorial: Diversity of transcripts emanating from protein-coding genes", "year": "2018", "source": "Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology, vol. 75, pp. 1-2", "authors": ["Rasko J", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Cover Image", "year": "2018", "source": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA\r\n, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. e1490", "authors": ["Shirokikh N", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Translation initiation by cap-dependent ribosome recruitment: Recent insights and open questions", "year": "2018", "source": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA\r\n, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. e1473 (1-45)", "authors": ["Shirokikh N", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Transcriptome-wide mapping of RNA 5-methylcytosine in arabidopsis mRNAs and noncoding RNAs", "year": "2017", "source": "The Plant Cell, vol. 29, no. 3, pp. 445-460", "authors": ["David R", "Burgess A", "Parker B", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "Translation complex profile sequencing to study the in vivo dynamics of mRNA-ribosome interactions during translation initiation, elongation and termination", "year": "2017", "source": "Nature Protocols, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 697-731", "authors": ["Shirokikh N", "Archer S", "Beilharz T", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "RNAModR: Functional analysis of mRNA modifications in R", "year": "2016", "source": ". bioRxiv - 080051not peer-reviewed", "authors": ["Evers M", "Shafik A", "Schumann U", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "METTL3 Gains R/W Access to the Epitranscriptome", "year": "2016", "source": "Molecular Cell, vol. 62, no. 3, pp. 323-324", "authors": ["Schumann U", "Shafik A", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "In Planta Determination of the mRNA-Binding Proteome of Arabidopsis Etiolated Seedlings", "year": "2016", "source": "The Plant Cell, vol. 28, no. 10, pp. 2435-2452", "authors": ["Reichel M", "Liao Y", "Rettel M", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "The emerging epitranscriptomics of long noncoding RNAs", "year": "2016", "source": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms, vol. 1859, no. 1, pp. 59-70", "authors": ["Shafik A", "Schumann U", "Evers M", "Thomas Preiss"]}, {"title": "ll Ribosomes Are Created Equal.

Thus, the kinds of protein molecules that are found in a given cell determine its characteristics and cells respond to changes in their environment by adjusting the abundance of some or many proteins in their collection. The instructions for the assembly of proteins are encoded in the genes and this information is expressed via intermediary molecules called messenger (m)RNA. Both, transcription of the genes into mRNA molecules and their subsequent translation by the ribosomes into protein are tightly controlled steps in the gene expression pathway. Erroneous gene expression is a major factor in human disease and dysregulation of translation is linked to a growing spectrum of illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, viral infection, and less frequent hereditary syndromes. The project proposed here is prompted by emerging evidence for a role of translational regulation in controlling the balance between cell death and survival. Tipping this balance has disastrous consequences for an organism as evidenced by its involvement in many major disorders (e. g. stroke, heart failure, neurodegeneration, AIDS, cancer, autoimmunity). Our aim is to test the hypothesis that a putative translational regulator termed p97-DAP5-NAT1, and a specialised mechanism of translation initiation by internal ribosome entry are important for the maintenance of this balance. To investigate this, we will employ DNA chips, a novel tool from Genomics research that allows the measurement of the levels of thousands of mRNA molecules in a single experiment. It is conceivable that knowledge of these special mechanisms of translation will lead to novel targets for therapeutic intervention, and this work will contribute some of the experimental tools to explore these avenues in the future.", "title": "Translational control of gene expression and the choice between cell death and proliferation", "id": "94881", "institutions": ["Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/256307", "researchers": ["Prof Thomas Preiss"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 378000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:09Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:23Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Thomas Preiss"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/256307", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/256307", "256307"], "subjects": ["270201", "RNA-binding protein", "VEGF", "apoptosis", "mRNA translation", "microarray", "angiogenesis", "cancer and related disorders", "cell death", "microarrays", "molecular basis of disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94881"}]}, {"description": "Genetic information resides in the DNA of our genome; however, to use this information it must be transcribed into chemically related RNA molecules, collectively known as the transcriptome.
