Pattern-recognition receptors are germ-line encoded innate immune sensors which detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

We use cutting-edge technology to study the mechanisms by which host sensors recognise bacteria, viruses and parasites, and how these sensors shape the overall immune response to infection. We investigate the role of disease-fighting immune proteins in destroying multidrug resistant pathogens. We also study the molecular basis by which uncontrolled inflammation can lead to the development of cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases."], "biography": "Si Ming is a Clarivate\u2122 Highly Cited Researcher, recognised for producing, in the last decade, multiple highly-cited papers that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and year in the Web of Science\u2122.", "project": ["We welcome applications from undergraduate, Honours, PhD, research  assistant and Postdoctoral applicants.
