It is our means of  driving safely through traffic, avoiding obstacles, perceiving food we  want to eat, reading, and recognising the face of a loved one. But at  any given moment, there is far more information available to process in  visual scenes than our brain is capable of processing to the level of  awareness. This means that visual attention has a fundamental triaging  role to play in shaping our perception of the world, by selecting  certain relevant information for privileged processing, while filtering  out other information.In many real-world visual tasks, the size of the spatial area over  which we apply our attentional resources is important. For example, when  driving a car, reading the speedometer requires a narrow focus of  spatial attention, whereas monitoring the road for any movement (e.g.,  child approaching the road, trajectories of other cars) requires a broad  focus. Similarly, when watching a crowd of people, recognising an  individual face requires a narrow focus of attention, while determining  the direction in which the majority of the crowd is moving requires a  broader one.Laboratory research has confirmed that different attended-region  sizes benefit different aspects of visual perception. For example, a  narrow attended-region enhances perceptual acuity for fine spatial  details, whereas a wide one facilitates visual search over multiple  diverse objects. Crucially, the fact that different attended-region  sizes are variably optimal for particular tasks implies that to  successfully support dynamic and complex real-world vision, a critical  task is not just to set a size for spatial attention, but to be able to  flexibly alter (i.e., switch) this size in a rapid and efficient  fashion. For example, attentional re-sizing underlies being able to  quickly alter attended-region size from narrow focus on the speedo to  broad focus on the whole scene to avoid collisions. My research is  largely focussed on examining the perceptual consequences of different  attended-region sizes, identifying which individuals are more efficient  at attentional re-sizing, and whether attentional re-sizing flexibility  is a skill that can be improved or trained.Key Research Interest:\u00a0Anxiety and AttentionIndividuals with trait anxiety and social anxiety have an attentional  bias toward threatening information in their environment. These biases  appear to not only characterise anxiety, but also to be causally  implicated in its origin and maintenance.\u00a0For example, when giving a  speech, an individual with social anxiety favours attending to the one  frowning, bored-looking face, while ignoring the neutral or smiling  faces in the crowd. Such selective processing of environment can distort  these individuals' experiences of events, and ultimately exacerbate  their anxiety. I am interested in improving our understanding of the  cognitive processes that underlie such attentional biases.\u00a0Key Research Interest: The Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Conscious Object PerceptionThe human visual system is continuously confronted with dynamic  visual input. This means that the system must parse this ongoing input  into discrete objects to transform it into the coherent and stable  visual scene that we consciously perceive. For example, when walking  down a crowded street, there are a large number of people, who are  moving, and can disappear temporarily behind other objects. From this,  the system needs to infer what stimulation belongs to a continuing  object over time (e.g., the same person, despite changes in their  appearance because of viewpoint variation and location), versus what  belongs to distinct objects (e.g., two different people who might occupy  the same location between successive glances).Therefore, the visual  system regularly has to draw an inference of whether input from a given  location belongs to a continuous object identity through time (object  continuity), versus two (or more) separate objects (object  individuation). Such inferences occur before conscious perception, but  ultimately determine our subjective experience of the world. I am  interested in the mechanisms that underlie and influence inferences of  object continuity versus object individuation. To do, I have studied  these questions most extensively via object-substitution masking (OSM).Key Research Interest: Migraine Migraine affects about 1 in 7 people, but about half of those do not  know that they have migraine. I am interested in improving general  knowledge about migraine, its characteristics, and treatments options.  For instance, my recent research revealed that 1 in 5 migraineurs did  not know that there are prescription medications available to help  reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. This means that people are  missing out on available treatments, and may be suffering  unnecessarily. There are also acute medications available which help to  minimise a migraine once it starts. However, these need to be used  sparingly, because over-use of such treatments can lead to rebound  headaches - creating the issue for which treatment is sought. Overuse of  such medications is a common route via which migraines transition from  episodic to chronic. Despite this, my recent found that 1 in 5  migraineurs were not aware of this risk. Again, this calls for public  health campigns to improve migraine awareness."], "biography": "", "project": ["Future Fellowship, The Causes and Consequences of Attentional Re-sizing Flexibility, awarded by the Australian Research Council to Stephanie Goodhew, $756,576 (2017-2021)", "This project aims to investigate the mechanisms of dynamic re-scaling of visual attentional focus. Such changes are critical for task performance, yet to date almost nothing is known about the processes underlying them, other than that they can be slow. Using an innovative cognitive psychology approach integrating individual-differences, experimental, and training frameworks, this project expects to generate new theoretical knowledge about attentional rescaling and insights into how to improve it. The expected practical outcomes include selection and training programs for specific contexts (e.g., athletes). This should provide significant economic benefits, such as optimising performance prior to other costly forms of training.", "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA), The Temporal Dynamics of Conscious Object Perception, $371,220.00 (2014-2016)", "We live in a constantly changing visual world. Thus a key inferential challenge that the human brain must solve is whether ongoing visual input represents a single object varying over time (for example, one person moving through a scene), or two distinct objects (for example, two different people successively occupying the same location). This project will investigate, for the first time, how the brain optimises this inference by using information about context, whether the flexibility of the inference process reduces with ageing, and the role of the two main visual pathways in this inference.
