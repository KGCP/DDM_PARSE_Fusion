electoral outcomes and what determines the strategies they use to contest them. To date, scholars have primarily focused on why post-election protests succeed, paying scant attention to the reasons political parties decide to reject election results in the first place. This project also seeks to evaluate the impact that post-election disputes and their resolutions have on the future of political parties and democratic governance. The findings of the project may inform and improve donor and civil society efforts to strengthen electoral management and the quality of democracy.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE160101469", "id": "663708", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160101469", "researchers": ["Dr Svitlana Chernykh"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 368000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:32Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160101469", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160101469", "DE160101469"], "subjects": ["POLITICAL SCIENCE", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663708"}]}]}
