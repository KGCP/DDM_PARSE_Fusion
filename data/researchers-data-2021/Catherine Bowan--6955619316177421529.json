Her recent work has drawn upon\u00a0music's potential to be used as a heuristic device in the telling of transnational histories, while exploring\u00a0uses of music in the nineteenth and early twentieth century radical political sphere\u00a0across the Anglophone world.\u00a0This extends in important ways previous research on early twentieth-century Australian music which was recontextualised within the broader framework of the British World. Formal and informal networks and personal connections inform her current research interests which focus on questions of internationalism, cosmopolitanism and transnational history with reference to early twentieth-century musical modernisms and more particularly the interwar history of the International \u00a0Society for Contemporary Music.\u00a0Journals published in include the Journal of the Royal Music Association, Musicology Australia and Labour History Review (UK). Her article 'Between Worlds Ancient and Modern: The Musical Collaboration of Kathleen Schlesinger and Elsie Hamilton' won the International Association of Women in Music's Pauline Alderman Award for Best Article of 2013."], "biography": "Kate Bowan is a Lecturer at the Centre for Heritage and Museum Studies \u00a0in the Research School of Humanities and the Arts at the Australian National University.
