The research provides training in molecular biology, protein engineering (directed evolution), enzyme kinetics, biochemistry, plastome transformation, tissue culture, measuring leaf photosynthesis and plant growth. Despites Rubisco\u2019s pivotal role in photosynthetic carbon assimilation \u2013 catalysing the primary step of incorporating CO2 into carbohydrates that are used to store and transport energy - it is surprisingly an inefficient enzyme in need of improvement. It constitutes about 20 to 30% of soluble leaf protein due to its inefficiency. The catalytic inadequacies of Rubisco (such as a slow turnover rate and poor ability to distinguish CO2 from O2) frequently limit the growth capacity of many plants, including most crops. As such, Rubisco has been studied intensively as a prime target for genetic engineering as a means to supercharge photosynthesis and improve growth efficiency. Towards this significant challenge, the primary foci of research in the Whitney laboratory utilises recent technological and conceptual breakthroughs to study Rubisco biogenesis, modify its catalysis, understand its regulation by Rubisco activase and generally tackle the challenges faced in developing strategies for enhancing Rubisco activity to improve plant productivity."], "biography": "Dr Whitney\u00a0undertook his BSc (Botany, Biochemistry and Chemistry) honours and PhD at James Cook University of North Queensland\u00a0where he\u00a0discovered unique molecular and biochemical features of the photosynthetic CO2-fixing enzyme, Rubisco, from\u00a0the symbiotic marine microalgae\u00a0found in\u00a0corals and clams. In 1996 he moved to the ANU to begin his postdoctoral studies and expanded his interest in interrogating Rubisco biology using plastome transformation biotechnology. His pivotal work on modifying plant photosynthesis via Rubisco engineering led to him being awarded the Goldacre Award in 2002 from the Australian Society of Plant Scientists and an International Photosynthesis Congress Young Scientist Award in 2004. From 2004-09 he held an ARC Research Fellowship and in 2009 was awarded an ARC Future Fellowship. His research is an integral part of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis and the Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Modifying Plant Photosynthesis and Growth via Simultaneous Chloroplast Transformation of Rubisco Large and Small Subunits", "year": "2020", "source": "The Plant Cell, vol. 32, pp. 2898-2916", "authors": ["Martin Avila E", "Lim Y", "Birch R", "Spencer Whitney"]}, {"title": "Directed Evolution of an Improved Rubisco;
