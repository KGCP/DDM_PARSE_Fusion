I am interested in understanding multiple aspects of the body image construct, exploring differences in body image and its outcomes according to gender, health status and development, and innovative approaches to prevention and intervention programs fostering a positive connection with the body to promote mental health, enhance health promoting behaviours such as intuitive eating and physical activity, and decreasing health depleting behaviours such as disordered eating and sedentary behaviours. I also have interests in psychological stress, interprofessional practice and innovations in clinical care."], "biography": "Kristen is currently a Lecturer in the Research School of Psychology at the ANU where she is teaching within the Master of Professional Psychology program.
