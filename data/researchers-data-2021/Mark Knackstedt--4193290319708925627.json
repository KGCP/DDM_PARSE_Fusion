The prevention of these fractures is based on estimation of bone strength. The decision whether someone needs treatment, or the effectiveness of a treatment can only be judged by estimating bone strength. The bottom line is that currently we cannot correctly estimate bone strength. Present methods such as bone mineral density (BMD) perform poorly. Most people who fracture are not detected by BMD because their BMD is either normal or high, and many people with low BMD never fracture. The main aim of this grant application is to develop new tools to allow doctors and scientists worldwide to better estimate FN strength. To develop new methods to replace BMD, scientists need to make use of the 3D aspects of the bone such as size, shape and internal architecture. Presently, these 3D aspects (structure) have not been adequately studied and scientists incorrectly approximate them. As a result new methods are not any better. A good quantification of structure is needed. Another reason for the failure to accurately estimate the strength of bones is that estimates are based on a single parameter whereas the bone, like any architectural structure (e.g. building), comprises many components acting together to maintain its strength. To determine the strength based on density alone is incorrect; the size, the shape and things inside the structure need to be considered as a whole. After quantifying correctly the structure and components of bone strength, we will determine how they can be used individually and together to better estimate the strength of the FN in men and women. Tools generated will be used to better determine people likely to fracture and needing treatment; to better tailor and monitor treatments. A better understanding of the causes and epidemiology of fractures will ensue.", "title": "Structural Basis of Femoral Neck Strength", "id": "94342", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400139", "researchers": ["Dr Roger Zebaze", "A/Pr Mark Knackstedt", "Prof Ego Seeman", "Prof Eleanor Mackie", "Prof Roger Price"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 751823.4, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:52:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:55:56Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ego Seeman"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400139", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400139", "400139"], "subjects": ["Endocrinology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Biomechanics", "Bone", "Fractures", "Disabilities", "Osteoporosis"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94342"}]}, {"description": "Cortical (outer shell) or compact bone constitutes 80% of the skeleton.
