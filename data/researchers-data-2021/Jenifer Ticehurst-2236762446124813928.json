Her early research focused on the biophysical components of agriculture in soil, water and the agronomic system. While more recently she broadened her interests to include economic, ecological, social and governance criteria when informing the management of agricultural and natural resources. She has a strong interest in integrated assessment and modelling, with a particular focus on developing decision support tools using participatory processes, such as Bayesian networks.Her recent research focuses on the conjunctive use and management of water within the Murray Darling Basin, and the potential for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) to provide an adaptation option suitable for irrigators and the environment. A new research area for her is using general surveillance (i.e. people from all walks of life) to assist in the early detection of biosecurity threats to Australia\u2019s agricultural production and natural environments."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Development of an integrated model for the Campaspe catchment: A tool to help improve understanding of the interaction between society, policy, farming decision, ecology, hydrology and climate", "year": "2018", "source": "8th International Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Management, IWRM 2018, ed.
