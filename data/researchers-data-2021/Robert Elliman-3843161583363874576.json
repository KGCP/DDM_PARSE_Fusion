This has the potential to improve device manufacturability and functionality. In thin film form, transition metal oxides can be subjected to intense electric fields and exhibit characteristic resistance changes suitable for non-volatile memory applications. However, their electrical response depends critically on stoichiometry and this must be precisely engineered for optimal device performance. This project aims to develop next-generation memory devices as a replacement for current flash memory. The proposed technology uses resistance changes in functional-oxides to store information, and offers the potential for smaller and faster memory.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP150100693", "id": "625931", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100693", "researchers": ["Prof Robert Elliman", "Dr Dinesh Venkatachalam", "Dr Jonathan England", "Dr Simon Ruffell"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 410000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:51Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100693", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100693", "LP150100693"], "subjects": ["CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/625931"}]}]}
