The research program is an integral component of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology (see below). The Centre offers Honours scholarships and topup scholarships for PhD students, in addition to well funded research, conference travel and graduate training programs. 1.\u00a0 Chloroplast retrograde signalling and Drought. We are studying the mechanisms by which plants perceive and respond to drought and excess light. This requires signals from the chloroplast to the nucleus, a process known as retrograde signaling. We have uncovered a molecular that moves between the two organelles to regulate gene expression and are investigating its function in Arabidopsis. We are applying this knowledge to the development of drought tolerant wheat.2. Carotenoid dervitaives as retrograde signals in plant development and acclimation to stressOur work is focused on the characterization of plant pigments, particularly carotenoids and their role in photosynthesis and chloroplast development. Carotenoids are important pigments in photosystems, many fruits, flowers, and seafood. Nutritionally they are the source of vitamin A and offer some protection against certain cancers, heart and eye diseases. Thus, understanding their biosynthesis may lead to improved nutritional value of foods. The goals are to elucidate the mechanisms that control carotenoid accumulation using biochemical genetics.\u00a0Novel carotenoid cleavage products, yet to be identified, impact diverse processes in plants. What they are and how they function is under investigation.3. Leaf to leaf systemic signalling\u00a0A leaf exposed to full sunlight will transmit a signal to shaded leaves enable a systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) response. The nature and regulation of SAA is under investigation.4. Optimising Energy Use Efficiency:\u00a0A goal of the ARC Centre of Excellence and our IWYP grant on wheat is to determing the constraints on energy capture and use by a cell, then select for crops and identify the underlying genes that will improve energy use efficiency and thus yield.5.

We propose a novel approach to improve sustainable yield by optimising the overall efficiency of energy capture, conversion and use by plants. Efficiency gains in metabolism, transport, and development will be more effective than optimising single nutrient inputs or product outputs. Improving multiple parameters simultaneously is a necessary solution to the increasing demand for more crop yield from finite land, water, and nutrient resources. Unpredictable environmental challenges adversely affect plant growth and further perturb plant energy balance, limiting yield. The epigenetic controls, gene variants and signals discovered will provide a new basis for sustainable productivity of crops and will future-proof plants in changing climates.", "title": "ARC Centres of Excellences - Grant ID: CE140100008", "id": "518507", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/CE140100008", "researchers": ["Prof Andrew Millar", "Prof Barry Pogson", "Prof Stephen Tyerman", "Prof Ian Small", "Prof James Whelan", "A/Prof Justin Borevitz", "Prof Ryan Lister", "Prof Owen Atkin", "Dr Matthew Gilliham", "Prof Rana Munns", "Prof Mark Stitt", "Prof Dr Ralph Bock", "Prof Joseph Ecker", "Prof Joanne Chory", "Dr Elizabeth Vierling", "Prof Eva-Mari Aro", "Prof Asa Strand", "Prof Ping Wu"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 26000000, "fundingScheme": "ARC Centres of Excellences", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:26Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:08:04Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/CE140100008", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/CE140100008", "CE140100008"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518507"}]}]}
