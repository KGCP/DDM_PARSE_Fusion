In addition to institutionally-awarded funding I have received grants from the Hannah Institute for the History of Medicine, the Canadian High Commission, the National Institute for Social Sciences and Law, the National Library of Australia, and the Huntington Library.\u00a0In 2013 the New York State Archives named me 'researcher of the year' in recognition of my publications based on its collections. In 2014 I was awarded a fellowship at the Huntington Library, which further supported the research for my most recent book, published by New York University Press in 2016.\u00a0I have extended my expertise in crime, justice and gender through my research on the history of sex murder and capital punishment in post-Confederation Canadian history. This research has led to the production of a monograph and several articles.I am currently returning to the field of twentieth-century Australian history through the analysis of inter-gender homicide. Initial funding for this project was awarded through a collaborative inter-School research grant from the\u00a0Research School of Social Sciences.In 2019, I was awarded a five-year strategic initiative grant from the Research School of Social Sciences to co-ordinate a cross-campus network on the History and Legacies of Violence. Affiliates and updates are listed on the dedicated website:\u00a0https://www.thehistoryandlegaciesofviolence.com/"], "biography": "", "project": ["My latest book 'The Death Penalty and Sex Murder in Canadian History' covers the period from Confederation (1867) to the abolition of the death penalty (1976). It is supported by a joint ARC Discovery Grant. I completed the manuscript as a visiting professor in the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto, in 2018. It was published by the University of Toronto Press in 2020.\u00a0https://utorontopress.com/us/the-death-penalty-and-sex-murder-in-canadian-history-2", "The project I have just completed, also supported by an ARC Discovery grant, examines the history of discretionary justice in New York State. Discretionary Justice: Pardon and Parole in New York, from the Revolution to the Depression (New York University Press, 2016) extends the insights I developed in my 1996 edited collection, Qualities of Mercy: Justice, Punishment and Discretion (UBC Press, 1996). It also builds on my publication,\u00a0\u201cThe Unwritten Law of Executive Justice: Pardoning Patricide in Reconstruction-era New York,\u201d Law and History Review, 28 4(November 2010): 891-30. I challenge Foucauldian scholarship's fixation on sovereign power as the capacity to inflict violence by focusing on the gubernatorial prerogative of mercy, and I track its bureaucratisation over the late-19th and early-twentieth centuries through the emergence of a disciplinary apparatus, marked by indeterminate sentencing, parole and the rise of the 'psi' complex.", "Two further projects flowed from this grant. The first was a feature radio documentary, produced for ABC's Hindsight: 'Patricide! A Murder Close to Home'. This production draws on interviews with historians Natalie Zemon Davis, Charles Rosenberg, and Timothy Gilfoyle, and includes dramatisations of an 1873 murder trial in New York City, which brought the relationship between\u00a0family, violence and honour to the fore. Using this high-profile case, I interrogate contemporary concerns over the legal and cultural erosion of masculine familial prerogatives; the medicalisation of criminal responsibility; women's growing use of law to advance individual and collective ambitions and citizenship aspirations; and rising suspicion over the place of sentiment in legal dispositions.", "The second project was a major international conference on 'Honour Killing across Culture and Time',\u00a0 8-9 December 2011. Inspired by contributions to this conference I co-edited two books: Honour, Violence and Emotions in History (London: Bloomsbury, 2014) (with Robert Cribb and Christopher Forth); and Honour Killing and Violence: Theory, Policy and Practice (London: Palgrave, 2014) (with Aisha Gill and Karl Roberts)."], "publication": [{"title": "Where", "year": "2020", "source": "s the government on domestic violence?", "authors": ["Carolyn Strange", "Mortensen J"]}, {"title": "Murderess or Miscarriage of Justice?
