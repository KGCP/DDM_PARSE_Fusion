Her current teaching interests are in the public law sphere, particularly administrative law and constitutional law. Robin's research interests are catholic in administrative law terms-although she has a specialty interest in administrative tribunals, an area in which she has both a practical and an academic interest, having been a member of\u00a0four Commonwealth, one ACT, and a private sector tribunal. In conjunction with other administrative law colleagues she has also undertaken seminal empirical research into the impact of judicial review cases-both within government and also for successful applicants and their lawyers. She has a wider interest in regulation and administrative law which she explored as a Commissioner of the ACT's Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission. Robin was a member for over a decade of the Administrative Review Council, the body which kept a watching brief on the Commonwealth's administrative law system. She is also one of Butterworths veterans' affairs editors for its Administrative Law Service a position she has filled since 1985. Her expertise in that area lead her, with Peter Sutherland, to write the first text in this area-Veterans' Entitlements Law (2000), now in its 3rd edidtion\u00a0Robin is also a co-author of Laying Down the Law (9th edn, 2015) the most widely used introductory text for law students, and Control of Government Action (4th edn, 2015) a\u00a0widely used\u00a0administrative law text.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Veterans", "year": "2016", "source": "Entitlements and Military Compensation LawThe Federation Press, Annandale, NSW", "authors": ["Robin Creyke", "Sutherland P"]}, {"title": "Tribunal Amalgamation 2015: An opportunity lost?", "year": "2016", "source": "Australian Institute of Administrative Law Forum, vol. 7, no. 84, pp. 54-73pp", "authors": ["Robin Creyke"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2016", "source": "Tribunal Amalgamation: What has been achieved?", "authors": ["Robin Creyke"]}, {"title": "Control of Government Action: Text", "year": "2015", "source": "Cases and CommentaryLexisNexis, Australia", "authors": ["McMillan J", "Robin Creyke", "Smyth M", ""]}, {"title": "Laying Down the Law 9th Edition", "year": "2014", "source": "LexisNexis ButterworthsChatswood, NSW, Australia", "authors": ["Cook C", "Robin Creyke", "Geddes R"]}, {"title": "Tribunals and Merits Review", "year": "2014", "source": "in M Groves (ed.), Modern Administrative Law in Australia, Cambridge University Press, USA, pp. 393-415", "authors": ["Robin Creyke"]}, {"title": "dministrative Law Evolution: An Academic Perspective", "year": "2010", "source": "Admin Review, vol. 59, no.
