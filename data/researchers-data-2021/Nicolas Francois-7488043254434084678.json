Great stretches of the ocean surface are covered by an organic microlayer called biofilm.

There is no fundamental understanding of how biofilms affect fluid motion. This project aims to use laboratory models and new measurement techniques to study and quantify the impact of biofilms on turbulent transport. Understanding these effects is important in a time of climate change and this knowledge may also help address environmental issues related to spreading of pollutants and flow control at the ocean surface.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE160100742", "id": "663633", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100742", "researchers": ["Dr Nicolas Francois"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 315000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:32Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100742", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100742", "DE160100742"], "subjects": ["CLASSICAL PHYSICS", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663633"}]}, {"description": "This project focuses on the efficient use of the energy of surface waves.
