In addition to reducing poverty and lifting living standards abroad, aid has always been linked to other interests such as the promotion of security, economic opportunity and other outcomes. This project will research relationships between identified values and geographical priorities in Australia's aid programme. In reconnecting history with the social science of applied economics, it will provide methodological paths for further research, including comparable studies of other governments giving aid. This project expects to add to understanding of Australia's role in world affairs and the significance of aid in Australia's international reputation.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP170102229", "id": "943765", "institutions": ["Deakin University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170102229", "researchers": ["Prof David Lowe", "Prof Mark McGillivray"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 376500, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:37Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:45:02Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Deakin University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170102229", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170102229", "DP170102229"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/943765"}]}]}
