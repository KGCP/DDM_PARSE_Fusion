This infrastructure is required to underpin the next generation of data-driven modelling and decision-support tools to enable the design of smart, productive and resilient cities. These capabilities are predicated on the adoption of ISO standards, development of new ontological frameworks and an urban data dictionary to enable semantic inferencing of datasets and the development of data structures and services. This framework would then be applied to data relevant to people, land and urban infrastructure to support comparative and multi-dimensional analytics.", "title": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities - Grant ID: LE160100174", "id": "664461", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE160100174", "researchers": ["Prof Abbas Rajabifard", "Prof Robert Stimson", "Prof Bill Randolph", "Prof Christopher Pettit", "Prof Jane Hunter", "A/Prof Jonathan Corcoran", "Prof Sharon Biermann", "Prof Robert Tanton", "Prof Barbara Norman", "Prof Pascal Perez", "Dr Saeid Mohsen Kalantari Soltanieh", "Dr Rohan Chandralal Wickramasuriya Denagamage"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 805000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:44:30Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE160100174", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE160100174", "LE160100174"], "subjects": ["URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING", "BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND DESIGN"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664461"}]}]}
