TORU is based at the Canberra Hospital but is part of the ANU Medical School. Diana teaches research methods and supervises medical student, clinician and higher degree research within the discipline of orthopaedics. She is also an Adjunct Professor at the University of Canberra and cosupervises Higher-Degree and Honours Physiotherapy students. Diana studied Physiotherapy at Sydney University and practiced clinically for more that 20 years both in Australia and the UK. During this time she gained an MSc with Distinction\u00a0from the University of East London. She obtained her PhD from ANU in 2011 for her thesis examining thoracic kyphosis and aging. Since this time she has managed and led the clinical research arm at TORU with membership of the scientific advisory committee for ACT Health Ethics, past deputy chair of the ANU Medical School Research Project Committee, Member of the ANU Medical School Research Committee, convenor of the Advanced Research Project Course and Associate Director of HDR for the medical school. She is well connected to the clinical community in her TORU role and also as immediate past president of the ACT Australian Physiotherapy Association.
