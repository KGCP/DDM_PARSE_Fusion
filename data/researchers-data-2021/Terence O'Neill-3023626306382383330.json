For a firm operating in an inefficient market these connections are vital to increasing the value of the firm, despite the potentially damaging effects of the misallocation of resources. Unfortunately, the literature on the importance of political connections and their value implications is scant. In this project, we develop a framework that depicts the interplay of political connections, institutional factors, corporate governance, media coverage and firm value. In particular, we investigate how political connections enhance the value of firms in China and how this changes as the market transitions.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150102339", "id": "617950", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102339", "researchers": ["Prof Tom Smith", "Prof Jing Shi", "Prof Terence O'Neill", "A/Prof Kathleen Walsh", "A/Prof Karen Benson", "Prof Dr Gary Tian", "Asst Prof Yongxiang Wang", "Dr Mamiza Haq"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 210100, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:02Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102339", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102339", "DP150102339"], "subjects": ["BANKING, FINANCE AND INVESTMENT", "COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES", "ECONOMICS REFORM; POLITICAL CONNECTIONS; POLITICAL REFORM"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617950"}]}]}
