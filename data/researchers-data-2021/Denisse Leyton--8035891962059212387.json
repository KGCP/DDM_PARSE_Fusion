Autotransporters are a large family of bacterial proteins that play key roles in the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases. Currently, the precise mechanism by which disease-causing molecules are assembled into the outer membranes of bacteria and mitochondria is poorly understood. The knowledge that the project develops may inform future strategies aimed at the rational treatment of bacterial and mitochondrial diseases.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT150100452", "id": "664407", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT150100452", "researchers": ["Dr Denisse Leyton"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 676900, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:51Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT150100452", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT150100452", "FT150100452"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664407"}]}, {"description": "Imagine a world in which any protein could be produced using a single production platform. This project aims to make this a reality by reengineering autotransporters, a large family of bacterial virulence factors with a modular structure that makes them amenable to rational design. The project plans to examine the structures and folding behaviour of autotransporters and reengineered derivatives fused to target heterologous proteins using biochemical, biophysical, and structural methods. It is expected that this project will provide fundamental insights into factors that dictate autotransporter folding and stability, which may enhance recombinant protein production and drive discovery of strategies to prevent autotransporter-mediated infection.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160103294", "id": "664164", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103294", "researchers": ["Dr Denisse Leyton", "Prof Ian Henderson"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 346800, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103294", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103294", "DP160103294"], "subjects": ["MICROBIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664164"}]}, {"description": "SPATEs are proteases secreted by many enteric bacteria that contribute to their pathogenic potential by damaging host tissues and evading the host immune response.
