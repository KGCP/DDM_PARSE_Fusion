Although much is already known about the way that light is detected and the signals are processed, a great deal remains to be learned. Some of the outstanding questions could be answered using modifications to a relatively new instrument called a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) which provides images of the interior of the eye. The aims of this project are to develop a modified SLO, which is able to measure the levels of visual pigment (rhodopsin) in the living eye, which is also able to deliver visual stimuli to the eye, and which finally is extended to use adaptive optics so that it can image and excite individual cone photoreceptors. Using this device, we will be able to measure the regeneration of visual pigment following exposures to intense illumination, to help explain the slow recovery of visual sensitivity after intense light. We will also be able to measure the electroretinogram (ERG) from localized retinal areas, to investigate how the properties of the photoreceptor cells vary across the retina. And finally we will be able not only to visualize the individual tiny cone photoreceptors, but also to stimulate them selectively, so that we can determine the responses of the different classes of cone (red-, green-, and blue-sensitive cones) in the living human eye.", "title": "Properties of human photoreceptors measured using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope to illuminate and image the retina", "id": "100651", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316939", "researchers": ["Prof Trevor Lamb", "Dr Brett Patterson", "Dr Fred Reinholz"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 352000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:50:00Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:57:09Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Trevor Lamb"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316939", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316939", "316939"], "subjects": ["OPTOMETRY AND OPHTHALMOLOGY", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "Electroretinogram", "Photoreceptors", "Retina", "Vision", "Visual pigment", "Eyes and Vision", "Retinal disease", "Retinal function", "Visual function"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100651"}]}]}
