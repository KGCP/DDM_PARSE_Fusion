He is an Environmental Modeller with over 400 publications in the open literature, half of these in refereed international journals. He has been a principal supervisor to over 60 graduated PhD students. Since 1997 he has also directed the iCAM Centre pursuing methods and applications of integrated assessment and decision support on water resource issues. He leads the Integration and Decision Support Program of the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training. Other scientific and organisational activities include: Editor-in-Chief, Socio-Environmental Systems Modeling (open access journal), Honorary Editor-in-Chief, Environmental Modelling and Software (Elsevier); Foundation and Past President, International Environmental Modelling and Software Society; Past President, Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand, Inc.; Past Vice-President, International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation; Board of Directors, The Integrated Assessment Society and of the Society for Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty; and regularly a member of scientific advisory committees of international conferences. In 2011 he received the Silver Medal of Masaryk University for contributions to environmental modelling and software. In 2012 he was awarded the Ray Page Lifetime Achievement Award from Simulation Australia. In 2015, 2017 and 2018 he was listed as a Highly-Cited Researcher by Clarivate/Thomson-Reuters (top 1%, computer science), and in 2015 was awarded an inaugural Lifetime Membership of the Modellling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand.
