His project is titled Aristotle\u2019s Australia and it traces the republican tradition in Australia from Federation till present day. Even though Australia is not a constitutional republic, this ancient philosophy with roots in classical Athens and Rome has shaped the national story and produced, at times, a stridently communitarian vision of citizenship.", "Aristotle\u2019s Australia will explore how civic republican concepts of government and citizenship impacted the development of democratic norms in Australia. Australian democracy is a bricolage of ideas with inspiration drawn from diverse traditions; however, orthodoxy has been established that is heavily reliant on a liberal reading of Australian political development. Without denying the impact of Lockean liberalism, Aristotle\u2019s Australia will investigate the impact of an ancient tradition of virtue and citizenship with roots in classical Athens and Rome. This work will be unique and innovative, offering a perspective of the civic and political bedrock of Australia not readily seen in its historiography.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Edward Smith Hall and the Introduction of Jury Trials to New South Wales", "year": "2018", "source": "Journal of Australian Colonial History, vol. 20, no. 2018, pp. 43-82pp", "authors": ["Hook S", "Benjamin T.
