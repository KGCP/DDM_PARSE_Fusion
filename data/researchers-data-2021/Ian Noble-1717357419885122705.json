I also played numerous roles in scientific synthesis reports such as the IPCC and the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment.\u00a0 I then spent 10 years at the World Bank playing a lead role in their efforts to achieve climate resilient development outcomes.\u00a0 Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "global assessment of adaptation
