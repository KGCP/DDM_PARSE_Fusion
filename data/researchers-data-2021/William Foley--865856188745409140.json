Evidence from agricultural and laboratory studies suggests that temperature dependent toxicity can have major effects on the intake and metabolism of plant secondary metabolites by mammals. These effects are mediated by a decrease in liver metabolism and by the effects of plant secondary metabolites on mitochondrial function which leads to greater heat production. The project will quantify the importance of temperature dependent toxicity and measures the changes in the cost of detoxification to better model the effects of climate change on marsupial herbivores.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140100228", "id": "518136", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100228", "researchers": ["Prof William Foley", "Dr Benjamin Moore", "Prof Maria Dearing"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 450000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:49:37Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:07:22Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100228", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100228", "DP140100228"], "subjects": ["ECOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "feeding", "foraging ecology", "plant secondary metabolite"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518136"}]}, {"description": "Terpenes give eucalypts their characteristic smell and mediate many interactions between trees and the environment. Studies of the genome show that eucalypts have more genes to make terpenes than any other plant.

The problem has been that the separations were labour-intensive and employed complex wet chemistry. New methods reduce the work-load enough to make compound-specific studies possible.
