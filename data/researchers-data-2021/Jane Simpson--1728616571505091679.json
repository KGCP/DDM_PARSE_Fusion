She then worked in Central Australia on Warumungu language and language maintenance, and helped set up a language centre in Tennant Creek. She also carried out various consultancies (e.g. Aboriginal Legal Aid, Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority), and worked on the Warumungu land claims.\u00a0 In 1987-89 with David Nash she worked as lexicography fellow at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, helping set up a digital archive of Aboriginal language material, which became ASEDA.\u00a0 In 1989 she became a lecturer in Linguistics at the University of Sydney. In 2005, with Mary Laughren and David Nash, she shared the Linguistics Society of America Summer Institute Inaugural Ken Hale Chair.\u00a0 In 2011 she moved to ANU as the inaugural chair of Indigenous linguistics and head of the School of Language Studies.\u00a0 In 2014 she stepped down as head of school and is now Deputy Director of the Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Junior skin names in Central Australia: function and origin", "year": "2020", "source": "in Paul Monaghan and Michael Walsh (ed.), More than mere words: Essays on language and linguistics in honour of Peter Sutton, Wakefield Press, Adelaide, pp. 165-191", "authors": ["Koch H", "Jane Simpson"]}, {"title": "Qualitative comparison in Warlpiri: semantic case, adposition and/or derivational affix?", "year": "2020", "source": "LFG\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd20 Conference, ed.
