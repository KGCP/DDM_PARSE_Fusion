Sotiris is founding co-chair of the International Consortium for Urban Environmental Health and Sustainability (Healthy-Polis) and Honorary Professor at the European Centre for Environment and Human Health at University of Exeter Medical School. Previously he was Head of the Environmental Change Department at Public Health England and held academic positions at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Birmingham. He was one of the lead authors of the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment and contributor to the National Adaptation Programme. He served as a member of the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK) Public Health Advisory Committee on Air Pollution. Over the last 20 years, he has advised national and local governments and international organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the European Parliament, on the health effects of climate change and air pollution, and on environmental sustainability and urban health. Sotiris has been involved in numerous research projects, including field studies, environmental modelling, risk assessment and policy analysis in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. His main research interests include climate change and health, air pollution and health, sustainable cities, sustainable transport, exposure assessment, epidemiology, health impact assessment, and environmental public health communication and policy. He is specialty chief editor (Health and Cities) for Frontiers in Sustainable Cities.", "project": [""], "publication": [{"title": "Urban greenspace and the indoor environment: Pathways to health via indoor particulate matter, noise, and road noise annoyance", "year": "2020", "source": "Environmental Research, vol. 180, no. 108850, pp. 1-13", "authors": ["Mueller W", "Steinle S", "Parkka J", "Sotiris Vardoulakis"]}, {"title": "dvancing Global Health through Environmental and Public Health Tracking", "year": "2020", "source": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, vol. 17, no. 6, pp. 1-19", "authors": ["Lauriola P", "Crabbe H", "Behbod B", "Sotiris Vardoulakis"]}, {"title": "Performance evaluation of a multiscale modelling system applied to particulate matter dispersion in a real traffic hot spot in Madrid (Spain)", "year": "2020", "source": "Atmospheric Pollution Research, vol. 11, no. 1, pp. 141-155", "authors": ["Santiago J", "Sanchez B", "Quaassdorf C", "Sotiris Vardoulakis"]}, {"title": "How Harmful Is Particulate Matter Emitted from Biomass Burning?
