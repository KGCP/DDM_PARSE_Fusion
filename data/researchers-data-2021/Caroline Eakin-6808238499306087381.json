Of all the stable continents, Australia is surprisingly seismically active, with intra-plate earthquakes occurring relatively frequently. However, these are unpredictable, placing lives and infrastructure at risk. This project offers the opportunity to use a new seismic experiment to improve detection of small events that may warn of a more dangerous earthquake to come, and provide sub-surface imaging of the hidden crustal boundaries and faults that are ultimately responsible. Benefits will include improved hazard assessment, and a new predictive model for exploration that relates regional seismicity, crustal faults, and mineral systems.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE190100062", "id": "1377966", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100062", "researchers": ["Dr Caroline Eakin"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 404000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:31Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:31Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100062", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100062", "DE190100062"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1377966"}]}]}
