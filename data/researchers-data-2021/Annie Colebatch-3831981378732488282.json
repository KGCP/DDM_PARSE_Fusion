Catalysis is the acceleration of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy required through addition of very small quantities of highly active chemicals (catalysts). This is of great significance industrially, as it is estimated that 90% of all products use catalysis during manufacture, environmentally, as catalysis reduces energy requirements for processes, and from a fundamental perspective for our understanding of chemical reactions.Our focus is on understanding how such processes occur with homogeneous transition metal catalysts. The rational design of efficient catalytic systems requires knowledge of how catalysts and substrates behave in order to tune their reactivity and thereby deliver enhanced performance.We are interested in designing organometallic catalysts which utilise molecular cooperativity. Our work involves the synthesis of ligands and their transition metal complexes, and studying their reactivity and catalytic behaviour, using an array of techniques including NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography."], "biography": "Annie completed her undergraduate degree and PhD at the Australian  National University.
