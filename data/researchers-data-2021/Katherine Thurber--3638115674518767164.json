She previously completed her MPhil and PhD in Epidemiology at ANU. Her driving ambition is to conduct policy-relevant research to support health improvement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other populations experiencing health inequities. She conducts research across community- and policy-identified priority areas, including racism, tobacco control, and family and community safety. She employs community-engaged, mixed-methods, and strength-based research approaches.  Katie has experience in the design and analysis of large-scale and longitudinal studies.\u00a0She has led collaborations analysing data from current largest cohort studies of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and adults, including the Longitudinal Study Indigenous Children (LSIC), the Study of Environment on Aboriginal Resilience and Child Health (SEARCH), and the 45 and Up Study, and is involved in development of\u00a0Mayi Kuwayu: The National Study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Wellbeing.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Strengths-based approaches for quantitative data analysis: A case study using the australian Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children", "year": "2020", "source": "Social Science and Medicine, vol. 12", "authors": ["Katherine Thurber", "Thandrayen J", "Banks E"]}, {"title": "Who responds?
