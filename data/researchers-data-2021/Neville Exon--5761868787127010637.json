My present research interests are in marine geology and geophysics in the broad sense, with a special interest in Australia's continental margin and marginal plateaus.\u00a0My role at ANU until my retirement in 2017 was Program Scientist in charge of the Australian IODP Office (AIO), which is responsible for the day-to-day running of Australia-NZ IODP Consortium (ANZIC) affairs, and responsible both to the ANU Delegate and to the ANZIC Governing Council. My role involved science planning, science administration and science encouragement on behalf of the Australian, and to a lesser extent New Zealand, marine geoscience communities that are involved in IODP. The Research School of Earth Sciences hosts AIO.IODP is the International Ocean Discovery Program, a major international research program to drill beneath the world\u2019s ocean bed, taking continuous cores in order to solve global scientific problems. Australia and New Zealand are participants in this program, with Australia\u2019s funding coming from the Australian Research Council, 13 universities, two government agencies and a marine geoscience peak body.
