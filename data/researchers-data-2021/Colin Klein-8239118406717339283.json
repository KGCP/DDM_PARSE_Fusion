information about the brain. What it shows about the mind is less clear. Addressing this fundamental philosophical question requires developing a detailed account of theory-testing in cognitive neuroscience. This project will connect neuroimaging to theories of explanation that focus on the way one variable can make a difference to another. By linking neuroimaging to facts about manipulable relationships between the brain and the mind, it will also provide a bridge between neuroimaging and complementary technologies for directly intervening on the brain. This in turn will provide a platform from which to explore the theoretical and ethical consequences of direct brain manipulation.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT140100422", "id": "618351", "institutions": ["Macquarie University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140100422", "researchers": ["Dr Colin Klein"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 609220, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:54Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Macquarie University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140100422", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140100422", "FT140100422"], "subjects": ["HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SPECIFIC FIELDS", "PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES", "FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING; INTERVENTIONIST ACCOUNTS OF EXPLANATION; PHILOSOPHY OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618351"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to provide a systematic and empirically-informed account of the way networks facilitate or hinder knowledge.
