The project will provide a detailed account of the context and impact of the cases in which Australia has been involved before the Court, and will assess the complex roles that adjudication and advisory opinions can play in the resolution of international disputes more generally. This project will document an historic set of engagements spanning 70 years and provide guidance on when international adjudication may be productive for Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and the international legal order. This will provide deeper knowledge of the capacities of international judicial institutions to resolve disputes relating to economic, health, social, cultural and environmental issues.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180101318", "id": "1316107", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180101318", "researchers": ["Prof Hilary Charlesworth", "A/Prof Margaret Young"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 424608, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:41Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:32Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180101318", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180101318", "DP180101318"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1316107"}]}]}
