In some of the social sciences women make up less than 15% of the professoriate. Yet these are the disciplines that should most aid our understanding of how gender works in society. The project asks what impact women&rsquo;s limited influence and status in these key fields of research has upon our capacity to grapple with the social and political changes necessary for progress toward gender equality. In doing so, it builds persuasive arguments about how and why gender matters in the social sciences. By examining how we judge excellence in social science research, the project will contribute to advancing women in all fields.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150104449", "id": "618228", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150104449", "researchers": ["Dr Fiona Jenkins", "Dr Helen Keane", "Em/Prof Marian Sawer", "Dr Claire Donovan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 397514, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:06Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150104449", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150104449", "DP150104449"], "subjects": ["OTHER STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "GENDER EQUITY; RESEARCH EXCELLENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618228"}]}]}
