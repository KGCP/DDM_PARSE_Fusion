This technique is measurement-based feedback cooling. Unlike the current evaporative methods, feedback cooling neither loses atoms, nor relies on elastic collisions or internal atomic structure. This opens up the possibility of directly cooling traditionally un-coolable systems. This project will expand the quality and range of available atomic sources, benefitting research into exotic materials, and improving precision sensor applications. Quantum sensors are rapidly reforming our image of what a sensor is and what it can do, offering unprecedented opportunities in sensor fusion, and directly impacting business opportunities in mineral exploration, mapping and navigation.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190101709", "id": "1378436", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101709", "researchers": ["Prof Joseph Hope", "A/Prof Nicholas Robins", "Dr Stuart Szigeti", "Dr Simon Haine"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 425000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:46Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101709", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101709", "DP190101709"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378436"}]}]}
