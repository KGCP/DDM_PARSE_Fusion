The penchant of women writers of this era for sentimental novels has led critics to take their writing at face value as apolitical and domestic. And their presentation of nature has, thus far, been dismissed completely. However, the natural landscape was not just a backdrop. On account of the supposed link between women and nature, women in post-revolutionary France were pigeonholed into a very restrictive sphere centred around domesticity and submission to their male counterparts. Yet Cottin, Genlis, Kr\u00fcdener, Souza and Sta\u00ebl re-appropriate nature in order to reclaim the voice denied to them and to their sex by society.\u00a0By highlighting self-expression, and by celebrating the figure of the melancholic wanderer, the social misfit, or the visionary, in the setting of an often tempestuous Nature, these writers also exerted substantial influence on the literary Romanticism which was soon to capture the European imagination.", "New Project:\u00a0Ecocritical Awareness in Eighteenth and early Nineteenth-century French Literature", "The project analyses late 18th- and early 19th-century French literature from an ecocritical perspective. It aims to shed new light on the way we view French literature of the Enlightenment, early Romanticism, the Industrial Revolution and the colonial period. It is a project with great potential for interdisciplinarity, exploring literature, sociological history, the historical portrayal of industrial development and ecological thought and centres around several areas of burgeoning research, including ecocriticism, ecofeminism, ecotheology, and postcolonialism.", "Enlightenment philosophes such as Montesquieu and Voltaire had argued in the early 18th century that geographical climate directly influenced society, politics and culture. However, by the 19th century, this argument had developed into the modern belief that society affects the environment, and that the latter must be conserved. In order to track the development of that about-turn in thought, I examine French literature from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.", "Thus far, I have developed two major research areas in the new project:", "1. Ecofeminist thought in 18th- and 19th-C French literature", "I spoke on this topic at the Australasian Association for Literature (AAL) annual conference in July 2017:\u00a0Literary Environments: Place, Planet and Translation.", "Output: Christie Margrave, \u2018Early Developments of Ecofeminist Thought in French Women\u2019s Early Romantic Fiction\u2019, Essays in French\u00a0Literature and Culture, 55 (2018) pp.43-62.", "2. Postcolonial Ecocriticism in 18th- and 19th-C French lit", "Through the lens of postcolonial ecocritical theory, I analyse the ways in which the history of the land is inseparable from Francophone socio-political history (both on a regional and an international level) in the works of writers including Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (the Indian Ocean), \u00c9variste Parny (Madagascar), Nicolas-Germain L\u00e9onard (the Caribbean), Le Vaillant (Africa), Traversay (Martinique), Bergeaud (Haiti), Saint-Lambert (North America), Marceline Desbordes-Valmore (Guadeloupe). Many of these authors\u2019 works are significantly understudied. However, bringing them to light through the lens of postcolonial ecocriticism (Deloughrey and Hangley (2011), Huggan and Tiffin (2010), Grove (1995)), allows the reader to perceive how they foreground landscape as a participant in the changing nature of France and her colonies, and allow us to begin to map the colonial metropole\u2019s relationship to non-metropolitan space.", "I presented a paper on this topic in a panel on Ecoregional Identities in collaboration with colleagues from the UK's Society of Dix-Neuvi\u00e9mistes at the ASFS conference in December 2018.
