Movements in asset prices affect private investors, public sector finances, wealth distribution and business activity levels. Economists have tried to build better models of asset prices, moving away from hyper-rationality and towards realistic features including heterogeneity, habit persistence and bounded rationality. These models&rsquo; additional complexity makes them difficult to solve or to apply to real world problems. The project will use modern hardware and computational tools, insights from economics literature and numerical analysis to provide a set of solution methods for such asset pricing models. This is expected to improve policy analysis and decision making under uncertainty.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT160100423", "id": "945037", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT160100423", "researchers": ["Prof John Stachurski"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 840480, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:45:08Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT160100423", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT160100423", "FT160100423"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/945037"}]}, {"description": "This project will provide a new methodology for analysing stability in economic systems.
