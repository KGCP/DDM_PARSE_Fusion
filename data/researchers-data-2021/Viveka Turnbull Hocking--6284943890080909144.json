Her research has included design for social innovation and sustainability as well as design for cross-species cohabitation. Her design-led approach to research engages with cross-disciplinary conversations and collaborations through the area of design and the built environment. She researches through the Fenner School of Environment and Society at the Australian National University and teaches in the School of Design and Architecture at the University of Canberra.", "project": ["1st Untaming the Urban\u00a0Symposium 2016: From post-anthropocentric design to urban ecologies, see http://untaming-the-urban.tumblr.com/", "2nd Untaming the Urban\u00a0Symposium 2018: Cross-disciplinary conversation on multi-species urban entanglements, see\u00a0https://untamingurban.org", "Untaming the Urban\u00a0- Book project", "Untaming Aesthetics: Cross-species design consideration for the built environment, see http://apo.org.au/node/178456", "", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Tackling Wicked Problems through Collective Design", "year": "2016", "source": "Intelligent Buildings International, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 24-36pp", "authors": ["Viveka Turnbull Hocking", "Brown V", "Harris J"]}, {"title": "Design-Led Approach for Enabling Collective Imagining of Sustainable Urban Futures", "year": "2016", "source": "in Leshinsky, R., Legacy, C.
