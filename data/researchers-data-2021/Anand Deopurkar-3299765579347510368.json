Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that uses geometric methods to analyse algebraic equations, with wide applications ranging from cryptography to genetics. Moduli spaces in algebraic geometry provide powerful methods to geometrically analyse collections of related equations. Using innovative new techniques, the project aims to generate new knowledge about fundamental moduli spaces. Expected outcomes include the establishment of an active community of algebraic geometers in Australia. These outcomes should provide significant benefits to pure mathematics and related scientific fields.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE180101360", "id": "1315402", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180101360", "researchers": ["Dr Anand Deopurkar"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 328075, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:29Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:10Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180101360", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180101360", "DE180101360"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1315402"}]}]}
