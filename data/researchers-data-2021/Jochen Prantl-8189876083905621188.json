Assembling a research team of international lawyers and political scientists, the project provides a rigorous, multi-disciplinary evaluation of why and when non-permament Council members have succeeded in impacting the Council&rsquo;s decision-making process, despite lacking the veto power available to the five permanent members. Drawing on recent experiences of elected members, including Australia, the project advances evidence-based and empirically grounded policy proposals designed to increase the capacity of elected members to exercise power and influence over the Council's agenda and policy.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150100300", "id": "617662", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100300", "researchers": ["A/Prof Christopher Michaelsen", "Dr Jeremy Farrall", "Dr Jeni Whalan", "A/Prof Jochen Prantl"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 488403, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100300", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100300", "DP150100300"], "subjects": ["LAW", "LAW AND LEGAL STUDIES", "INTERNATIONAL LAW; SECURITY COUNCIL; UNITED NATIONS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617662"}]}]}
