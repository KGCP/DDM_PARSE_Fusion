quality affects many rivers and receiving waters such as the Great Barrier Reef and Gippsland Lakes. This project will use Bayesian Heirarcical models of state-wide water quality data to quanitfy the effects of a range of factors on stream water quality including climate, landuse, river flow, vegetation cover, etc. The analysis will extract information from the entire data set rather than concentrating on individual sites. It will underpin a new predictive capacity including response to land use and management changes and climatic variations based on long-term data sets, as well as a water quality prediction capability. The models developed will jointly model a range of inter-related water quality parameters.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP140100495", "id": "618649", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100495", "researchers": ["Prof Andrew Western", "Dr Dongryeol Ryu", "Dr James Webb", "Dr Paul Leahy", "Dr Eva-Sabine Schreiber", "Mr Malcolm Watson", "Mr David Waters", "Mr Robert Goudey"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 315000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100495", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100495", "LP140100495"], "subjects": ["ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT", "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES", "CATCHMENT WATER QUALITY; CATCHMENT WATER QUALITY; SPATIAL ANALYSIS; SPATIAL ANALYSIS; STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSIS; STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSIS; STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSIS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618649"}]}]}
