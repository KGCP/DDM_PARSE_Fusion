Concepts and tools from applied history, cognitive science, system dynamics, resilience thinking, and complexity science have been blended to produce pragmatic ways for the members of a group to co-develop sustainable management policies. One aim of a CCM workshop is to increase a groups' awareness of, and allowance for, three critical sets of interactions: (a) the feedback interactions that occur between the parts of a complex adaptive system, (b) the interpersonal interactions that occur in cross-sector dialogue focused on problems of mutual concern, and (c) the interactions between studies of the past and plans for the future.", "CCM is also intended to provide ways for managers to escape the 'complexity dilemma'. The dilemma arises because human-environment systems are usually too complex to manage as a whole\u2014there is strong pressure to focus attention on selected sub-systems.\u00a0But, the behaviour of a complex system emerges from the interactions between its parts. If you take the system apart it simply disappears. It follows that an understanding of the possibility of decomposing a given system, while retaining key behavioural constraints, is critical in efforts to escape the complexity dilemma. In advanced CCM there is a focus on exploring decomposability via the development and testing of low-order dynamical models.", "On the practical front, policy makers and managers often assume that the systems they work within are always decomposable. This is illustrated, for example, by the natural emergence of isolated governance silos as cities grow and become more dynamically complex. Such an approach hides cross-sector feedback effects that can lead to policy failure. The CCM program is intended to help managers to minimse such failures.", "", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Cool Communities\u2014Urban Density, Trees, and Health", "year": "2018", "source": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, vol. 15, no. 7, pp. 1531-1547", "authors": ["Brown H", "Proust K", "Barry Newell"]}, {"title": "Escaping the complexity dilemma", "year": "2018", "source": "in Ariane Konig and Jerome Ravetz (ed.), Sustainability Science: Key issues, Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, London, pp. 96-112pp", "authors": ["Barry Newell"]}, {"title": "role for low-order system dynamics models in urban health policy making", "year": "2016", "source": "Environment International, vol. 95, pp. 93-97", "authors": ["Barry Newell", "Siri J"]}, {"title": "Urbanization, Extreme Events, and Health: The Case for Systems Approaches in Mitigation, Management, and Response", "year": "2016", "source": "Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health, 28 (2S), 15S\u201327S.\r\nDOI: 10.1177/10105395/559569", "authors": ["Barry Newell"]}, {"title": "Links between floods and other water issues in the himalayan and tibetan plateau region", "year": "2015", "source": "Pacific Affairs, vol. 88, no. 3, pp. 653-675", "authors": ["Wasson R", "Barry Newell"]}, {"title": "Systems thinking and the cobra effect", "year": "2015", "source": "Our World, United Nations University", "authors": ["Barry Newell", "Doll C"]}, {"title": "Conservation parks are growing, so why are species still declining?", "year": "2015", "source": "The Conversation", "authors": ["Hill R", "Barry Newell", "Gordon I"]}, {"title": "Why biodiversity declines as protected areas increase: the effect of the power of governance regimes on sustainable landscapes", "year": "2015", "source": "Sustainability Science, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. 357-369", "authors": ["Hill R", "Miller C", "Barry Newell"]}, {"title": "Understanding Human Ecology: A systems approach to sustainability", "year": "2015", "source": "RoutledgeTaylor & Francis Group, Oxon", "authors": ["Dyball R", "Barry Newell"]}, {"title": "Developing understanding of the carbon cycle through play with physical analogues", "year": "2013", "source": "24th Annual Conference of the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, ed.
