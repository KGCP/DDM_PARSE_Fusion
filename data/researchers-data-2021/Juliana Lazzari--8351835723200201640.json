My post-graduate research focus was on reptiles and small mammals persisting in small and isolated habitat patches in semi-arid, mallee landscapes.Isolated habitat patches in cropping landscapes are affected by disturbances including fire suppression. Some reptile species have habitat adaptations with preferences for successional fire stages e.g. early, mid and late. Because many of these habitat patches are long unburnt (fire suppressed), if a wildfire modifies the entire habitat, this could lead to species extinctions.\u00a0 Where wildfire has occurred across an entire habitat patch, I investigated if nearby large reserves containing a range of successional fire stages could provide source populations to wildfire affected patches.Fire is natural in many systems but as a result of landscapes being modified, fire regimes (frequency, intensity, and extent) have changed and may also be contributing to habitat loss. Fire could be used in these habitats to provide a range of successional habitat stages. Fire-age (or time since the last fire) of vegetation is important knowledge if fire is used as a tool to manage vegetation for habitat. Burning too frequently, or not frequently enough can result in vegetation changes undesirable to fauna and flora. My studies also included using models to predict fire-age in areas of mallee vegetation by using stem diameters and environmental co-variates including the percentage of\u00a0 bare ground, canopy cover, and so on."], "biography": "Juliana is a member of the Ecological Society of Australia and is president of the Australian Forest History Society.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Local environmental covariates are important for predicting fire history from tree stem diameters", "year": "2015", "source": "International Journal of Wildland Fire, vol. 24, no. 6, pp. 871-882", "authors": ["Juliana Lazzari", "Yoon H", "Keith D"]}, {"title": "Spatial dynamics of the knob-tailed gecko Nephrurus stellatus in a fragmented agricultural landscape", "year": "2012", "source": "Landscape Ecology, vol. 27, no. 6, pp. 829-841", "authors": ["Driscoll D", "Whitehead C", "Juliana Lazzari"]}]}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "how fire interacts with habitat loss and fragmentation", "year": 2021, "source": "biological reviews", "authors": [{"name": "don a driscoll", "affiliation": "deakin university"}, {"name": "dolors armenteras", "affiliation": "national university of colombia"}, {"name": "andrew f bennett", "affiliation": "la trobe university"}, {"name": "lluis brotons"}, {"name": "michael f clarke", "affiliation": "la trobe university"}, {"name": "tim s doherty", "affiliation": "deakin university"}, {"name": "angie haslem", "affiliation": "la trobe university"}, {"name": "luke t kelly", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "chloe f sato", "affiliation": "deakin university"}, {"name": "holly sitters", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "nuria aquilue"}, {"name": "kristian bell", "affiliation": "deakin university"}, {"name": "maria chadid", "affiliation": "national university of colombia"}, {"name": "andrea duane"}, {"name": "maria c mezaelizalde", "affiliation": "national university of colombia"}, {"name": "katherine m giljohann", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "tania marisol gonzalez", "affiliation": "national university of colombia"}, {"name": "ravi jambhekar", "affiliation": "azim premji university"}, {"name": "juliana lazzari", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "alejandra moranordonez"}, {"name": "tricia wevill", "affiliation": "deakin university"}], "id": 86137544}, {"title": "spatial dynamics of the knob tailed gecko nephrurus stellatus in a fragmented agricultural landscape", "year": 2012, "source": "landscape ecology", "authors": [{"name": "don a driscoll", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "catherine a whitehead", "affiliation": "flinders university"}, {"name": "juliana lazzari", "affiliation": "australian national university"}], "id": 104292366}, {"title": "local environmental covariates are important for predicting fire history from tree stem diameters", "year": 2015, "source": "international journal of wildland fire", "authors": [{"name": "juliana lazzari", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "hwanjin yoon", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "david a keith", "affiliation": "university of new south wales"}, {"name": "don a driscoll", "affiliation": "australian national university"}], "id": 65166364}, {"title": "fire and fragmentation interactions effects on reptiles and small mammals in modified semi arid landscapes", "year": 2019, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "juliana lazzari"}]}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
