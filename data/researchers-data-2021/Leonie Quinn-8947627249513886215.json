In order to proliferate, cells must double their DNA contents and segregate their chromosomes precisely into daughter cells. Collectively this series of events is referred to as the Cell Cycle. The cell cycle must be carefully regulated since inappropriate proliferation can cause developmental abnormalities and tumour formation in multicellular animals. Proliferation is regulated by a balanced set of interactions between two group of proteins, cell cycle activators and cell cycle inhibitors. Aberrations in cell cycle inhibitor proteins will cause excessive cell proliferation, the first step in the multi-step process of tumour development. It is important to understand the processes that normally inhibit cell proliferation, since cells undergoing more rapid cell cycles are much more likely to develop further errors in their genetic material and progress to later stage invasive tumours. This proposal focuses on a protein (FIR-Hfp) that we have shown to inhibit cell cycle progression in the vinegar fly (Drosophila Melanogaster), which is an excellent model organism for studying developmentally regulated cell proliferation. Furthermore, most cell cycle regulators are conserved in evolution, so the knowledge derived from these studies can assist with our understanding of how complex pathways might coordinate proliferation mammals. FIR-Hfp negatively regulates cell proliferation by down-regulating cycle activator proteins (dMyc and Stg). At present the mechanism for the inhibitory affect on these activators is not understood, but preliminary data suggests that FIR-Hfp might be involved in causing Stg and the dMyc activator protein (Hay) to be targeted for destruction. The aim of this project is to elucidate the mechanism by which Hfp regulates the activity of these potentially ocogenic factors, and thus gain a better understanding of the preliminary stages of tumour progression.", "title": "HFP ACTIVATES PROTEOLYSIS OF POSITIVE CELL CYCLE REGULATORS TO INHIBIT CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION IN DROSOPHILA", "id": "98003", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350267", "researchers": ["Dr Leonie Quinn"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 438750, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:50:44Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:41Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Dr Leonie Quinn"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350267", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350267", "350267"], "subjects": ["Cell Development, Proliferation and Death", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY", "Drosophila melanogaster", "cell proliferation", "control of mitosis", "transcription factors", "ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis", "cancer biology", "cell cycle inhibitors", "growth and development", "transcription", "tumour suppressor genes"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98003"}]}, {"description": "A major feature of tumour progression and cardiac hypertrophy (enlarged heart) is accelerated cell growth and protein synthesis. Moreover, increased synthesis of ribosomes (the protein synthetic machinery) is associated with malignancy and hypertrophy suggesting that it may play a causal role in tumour formation and cardiac disease. In support of this, specific inhibitors of both ribosome biogenesis and function are extremely effective at inhibiting the growth of some tumours and vascular smooth muscle. This study will examine the mechanisms that regulate ribosome synthesis. Specifically it focuses on a transcription factor termed UBF whose activity we think is critical for the regulation of the synthesis of the ribosomal RNA, the catalytic backbone of the ribosomes. Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) controlling UBF function will lead to a better comprehension of how cells modulate synthesis of functional ribosomes and how this process is deregulated during disease states associated with deregulated protein synthesis and growth such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer.", "title": "Regulation of ribosomal RNA gene transcription", "id": "97597", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400114", "researchers": ["Dr Leonie Quinn", "Prof Ross Hannan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 509017.62, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:52:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:18Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ross Hannan"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400114", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400114", "400114"], "subjects": ["BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "Biochemistry", "Cell growth", "Drosophila", "Gene regulation", "Ribosomal gene transcription", "Basic science", "Cancer and related disorders", "Control of growth", "Mechanisms"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97597"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to challenge the dogma that the ribosome behaves only as a &lsquo;&lsquo;house-keeper&rsquo;&rsquo;.
