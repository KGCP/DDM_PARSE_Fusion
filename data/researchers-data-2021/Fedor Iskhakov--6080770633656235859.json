interact with each other through time and how these interactions drive both the operation of, and value created in, economic markets. While recent theoretical models predominantly capture the complexity of these dynamic interactions, the methods for testing these models&rsquo; predictions against observed data do not. Instead, they are based on a range of simplifying assumptions that undermine the reliability of their analysis. This project will develop statistical and computational methods to better understand observed economic behaviour. By allowing the effects of proposed economic interventions and regulations ex ante, this project will support the development of more efficient and better-targeted policies in every area of the economy.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT180100632", "id": "1344045", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100632", "researchers": ["Dr Fedor Iskhakov"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 857585, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-02T04:21:13Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100632", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100632", "FT180100632"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1344045"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop consumer-centred approaches to reducing the harmful effects of confusion in financial decisions by studying superannuation investment and home loan decisions where confused choices are individually and collectively costly.
