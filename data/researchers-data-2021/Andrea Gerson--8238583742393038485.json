Although options to retard sulfide oxidation exist, including encapsulation methods, chemical additives and inhibition of iron-oxidising bacteria, these suffer from long-term instability. We aim to investigate mechanistic approaches, using readily available mineralogical materials, to provide passivating conditions resulting in slowed oxidation rates. Our focus is on treatments for wastes from iron ore deposits which are of high economic significance to Australia. The outcome will be a treatment &lsquo;pathway&rsquo; enabling practical waste rock treatment over the acid forming time-profile.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP140100399", "id": "618625", "institutions": ["University of South Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100399", "researchers": ["Prof Andrea Gerson", "Em/Prof Roger Smart", "Mr Richard Marton", "Dr Russell Schumann"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 330000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of South Australia"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100399", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100399", "LP140100399"], "subjects": ["OTHER CHEMICAL SCIENCES", "CHEMICAL SCIENCES", "ACID MINE DRAINAGE; ACID MINE DRAINAGE; SULFIDE MINERAL PASSIVATION; SULFIDE MINERAL PASSIVATION; SULFIDIC OXIDATION PATHWAYS; SULFIDIC OXIDATION PATHWAYS; SULFIDIC OXIDATION PATHWAYS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618625"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to determine why deposits of rare earth elements, which are critical for modern devices and technologies such as phones, tablets and plasma screens, are associated with carbonate magmas.
