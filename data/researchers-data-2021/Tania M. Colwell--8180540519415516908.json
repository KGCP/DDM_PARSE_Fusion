By investigating the patronage, presentation, transmission, and ownership of the surviving corpus of over thirty manuscripts produced between\u00a0c. 1380 and\u00a0c. 1530,\u00a0Reading M\u00e9lusine\u00a0explains how and why the texts retained their hold on later medieval imaginations, and explores how the cultural values embedded in the romances facilitated their circulation across France and beyond.", "Beyond Wonder: Emotions of Encounter in the Medieval World", "This project explores representations of emotions of encounter in a French collection of travel narratives and ethnographic texts produced between around 1300 and 1530. It examines shifts in the way emotions shaping experience of intercultural encounter were treated and understood and reflects on their implications for understandings of identity in and beyond France. Research for \u2018Beyond Wonder\u2019 has been supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence for the History of Emotions and national and international competitive funding.
