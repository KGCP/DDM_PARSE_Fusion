This volume addresses the theoretical lacuna in the literature  on China-Russia relations by bringing together leading scholars of  international relations from various theoretical perspectives, as well  as theoretically-informed experts in Chinese and/or Russian foreign  policy. The chapters work in combination to both improve our  understanding of a crucially important contemporary case, while also  advancing IR theory in substantial ways.", "Special Issue: International Relations Theory and China-India Relations (Under Review at Journal of Contemporary China)", "", "WORKING PAPERS", "Mixed Signals: The Limits of Reassurance in International Relations", "China\u2019s Rise and the \u2018Engagement-Containment\u2019 Debate", "Signaling and Socialization: Reassurance with Endogenous Preferences (with Kyle Haynes)", "The Policy Relevance of Formal Models", "How Third-Party Threats Facilitate Credible Reassurance", "Power Shifts, Multiple Audiences and Credible Cheap-Talk Signals", "Realism\u2019s Goldilocks Problem: Explaining Balancing Patterns in China-Russia Relations (with Alexander Korolev)", "Provocation versus Resolve in Coercive Bargaining (with Kyle Haynes)", "", "Book Manuscript: Uncertainty and Decline: Power Shifts, Credible Signaling, and US-China Relations", "How can the US and other states form accurate beliefs about the intentions of a rising China? Signaling during power shifts has also been dramatically undertheorized, and the literature on China\u2019s rise lack systematic criteria for inferring China\u2019s intentions. This project presents a novel theoretical framework that identifies conditions under which a rising state\u2019s behavioral signals are more or less credible, and criteria that scholars and policymakers can use to infer a state\u2019s foreign policy goals from its past actions.
