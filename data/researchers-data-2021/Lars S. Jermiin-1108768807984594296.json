He did postdoctoral research at La Trobe Univerity (1994-1995), Universit\u00e9 d'Ottawa (1995), the Australian National University (1995-1998), and the University of Sydney (1998-2001).In 2001 he was appointed to the position of Lecturer at the University of Sydney, then promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2004, and Associate Professor in 2008. In 2002 he co-founded the Sydney University Bioinformatics & Technology Center (SUBIT), and in 2003 was appointed its Director (2003-7). In 2009 he was appointed by the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial and Research Organisation's (CSIRO) of Australia to establish and lead a research team in genome bioinformatics at its Division of Entomology. In 2016 he was appointed Honorary Professor at the Australian National University, and in 2018 he was appointed Visiting Professor at the University College Dublin.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Genome-wide analysis of MIKC-type MADS-box genes in wheat: pervasive duplications, functional conservation and putative neofunctionalization", "year": "2020", "source": "New Phytologist, vol. 225, no. 1, pp. 511-529", "authors": ["Schilling S", "Kennedy A", "Pan S", "Lars S.
