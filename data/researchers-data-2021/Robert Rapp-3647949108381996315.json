"Because of its intrinsic compositional buoyancy, continental crust has traditionally been considered to be unsubductable in the denser underlying mantle. Yet some ocean island basalts carry a geochemical signature of recycled continental material in their plume source in the deep mantle.

These experiments will provide the first empirical constraints on the role of sediment-derived fluids in mantle metasomatism and the origin of economically-rich potassic magmas, and the nature of the ultrarefractory continental component that ultimately reaches the plume source for ocean-island basalts.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140103841", "id": "517575", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103841", "researchers": ["Dr Robert Rapp", "Prof Ian Campbell", "Dr Alan Jaques", "Prof David Pearson"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 166000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:51:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:42Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103841", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103841", "DP140103841"], "subjects": ["GEOLOGY", "EARTH SCIENCES", "lamproites", "mantle metasomatism", "sediment subduction"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517575"}]}, {"description": "The climate change debate has focused scientific attention on Earth&rsquo;s exogene carbon-cycle.
