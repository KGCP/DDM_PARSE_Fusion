This study is focussed on people who have developed melanoma at an early age (under 40yrs) and will compare their family history of cancer, skin features, genetic characteristics and various aspects of their previous sun exposure with people who don?t have melanoma. The large number of people involved and the fact that they will be selected at random from the population of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane which have very different melanoma rates, means that the study will be able to clarify what roles genes and environment play in the disease. It is intended to be an international benchmark in this regard, and Australia is the only country in which a study of this scope could be mounted. Potential benefits from this research will be a better understanding of the way sun exposure affects people differently, depending on their genetic makeup, the place of genetic testing in assessing people?s risk of melanoma, particularly if they have relatives with the disease, and way in which skin features like moles should be taken into account in that assessment.

This study will search for the identity of other genes of this kind. It will take advantage of a large network of researchers which has been working to recruit women with a strong family history of breast cancer from around Australia over the last two years. In this short time such large numbers of women have come forward that a study of this kind will be among the largest in the world. The results of this research, in terms of location of possible new genes causing high risk of breast cancer, will be shared with other researchers in Europe and the US who are working toward the same goals. This will ensure that progress is as rapid as possible. Based on experience with the two previously discovered breast cancer genes, this research will also shed light on the types of changes that drive the malignancy of breast cancer cells.
