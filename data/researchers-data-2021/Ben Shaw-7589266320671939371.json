Massim islands of eastern Papua New Guinea and investigate the long-term adaptive strategies prehistoric people used to live in changing island environments. Ecological constraints shaped indigenous cultural identities as sea levels fluctuated and island sizes varied after initial colonisation of Sahul (Ancient New Guinea-Australia). This project will examine how exchange networks facilitated settlement of resource impoverished island ecosystems. The anticipated outcome is to incorporate empirical data into a theoretical framework of adaptive cultural plasticity to develop a temporal-spatial model for human settlement in the Massim, New Guinea and Sahul with multi-disciplinary benefits for understanding climatic and human effects on flora, fauna and ecology.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE170100291", "id": "942433", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100291", "researchers": ["Dr Ben Shaw"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 365516, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:56Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100291", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100291", "DE170100291"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/942433"}]}]}
