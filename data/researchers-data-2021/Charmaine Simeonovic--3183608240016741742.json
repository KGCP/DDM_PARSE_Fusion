The pig targets recognised by the xenoreactive CD4 T cells are unknown. We plan to identify the major target(s) involved in cellular xenograft rejection. This information can then be used to specifically remove or disable only those CD4 T cells capable of recognising the pig tissue and hence facilitate xenograft survival or tolerance without immunosuppression. In this way, the remainder of the CD4 T cell population and immune system is preserved intact. Recent studies have demonstrated that a pig virus (PERV) can be transmitted from pig tissue xenografts to recipient tissues. Our studies have also suggested that the process of xenograft rejection and the immunological recognition of transplant recipient cells infected with the pig virus, are closely related. We plan to investigate this relationship and ascertain whether the immunological destruction of the pig tissue xenograft is largely due to an immune response generated against the pig virus(es) it carries. As an extension of this concept, we will investigate whether long-term xenograft survival (tolerance) is associated with lack of immune reactivity to the pig virus and hence a continual capacity for pig virus to be transmitted to host tissues. This outcome could result in the development of unwanted disease(s) in transplant patients. To prevent these problems, our studies will determine whether it will be essential for such pig virus to be eliminated from the donor pig tissue before transplantation, e.g. by the development of potent anti-viral agents and-or via the development of pig herds that have been genetically engineered to be pig virus (PERV)-deficient.", "title": "Major xenoantigens for neovascularised porcine xenografts: the role of PERV and MHC in rejection and tolerance", "id": "94495", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224206", "researchers": ["Prof Adrian Gibbs", "A/Pr Charmaine Simeonovic"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 504750, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:05Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Charmaine Simeonovic"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224206", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224206", "224206"], "subjects": ["320205", "Immune response", "Immunological tolerance", "Major Histocompatibility Complex", "Retroviruses", "Xenotransplantation", "Organ transplantation", "Tissue transplantation", "Type 1 Diabetes", "Xenozoonosis"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94495"}]}, {"description": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease which ultimately leads to the death of insulin-producing islet beta cells, elevated blood sugar levels and daily insulin injections.
