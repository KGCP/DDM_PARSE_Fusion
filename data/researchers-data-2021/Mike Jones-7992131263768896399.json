He has a  background in art history, and over a decade of experience working with  the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) on  digital, archival, and public history projects. In December 2018 he completed his PhD in History at the University of Melbourne's School of  Historical and Philosophical Studies (conferred in April 2019). The  resulting thesis, Documenting Artefacts and Archives in the Relational Museum, is an interdisciplinary look at the history of computerisation in  museums, the interconnectedness of archives and museum collections, and  the ways in which collections-based knowledge is conceptualised,  captured, and managed by large collecting institutions.As  of July 2019, Mike is based in the School of History at the Australian  National University, Canberra, working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow  on the Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate Program, Rediscovering the Deep Human Past (ARC FL170100121). The project  aims to develop a deeper understanding of Australia\u2019s pre-1788 history,  transforming the scale and scope of history through the analysis of  Australia\u2019s epic Indigenous narratives alongside relevant new scientific  evidence to create new approaches to the history of Greater  Australia/Sahul.", "project": ["This project will analyse Australia's epic Indigenous narratives  alongside relevant new scientific evidence in order to create a big  picture history of Greater Australia/Sahul, and as a result transform  the scale and scope of history. Fresh periodisations and understandings  will reorient this history in its wider global context. Through  critiquing the evolution of disciplines, especially the world  history/prehistory divide and the Cambridge training nexus, the project  will develop future-oriented transdisciplinary techniques for  researching the deep human past. As part of the project, a diverse  generation of early career scholars will join top international networks  and be trained in digital research techniques and delivery platforms  for researching this exceptional human history."], "publication": [{"title": "Collections in the Expanded Field: Relationality and the Provenance of Artefacts and Archives", "year": "2019", "source": "Heritage, vol. 2,
