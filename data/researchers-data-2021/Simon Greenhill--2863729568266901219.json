Language is central to human existence and to the flow of information. The Centre will address the most critical questions about language: How do languages evolve? How different can languages be? How do our brains acquire and process them? How can technologies deal with the complexity and enormous variability of language in its central role in human information processing? What can Australia do to increase its linguistic abilities at a time of increasingly multilingual demands in trade and information? The Centre will also secure language heritage, develop new language technologies, connect policy with indigenous and migrant communities, and build strategies to help 1st and 2nd language learning and those isolated by language difficulties.", "title": "ARC Centres of Excellences - Grant ID: CE140100041", "id": "518499", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/CE140100041", "researchers": ["Prof Nicholas Evans", "Prof Jane Simpson", "A/Prof Rachel Nordlinger", "Prof Anne Cutler", "Prof Gillian Wigglesworth", "Dr Simon Greenhill", "Dr Nicholas Thieberger", "Prof Janet Wiles", "Prof Helen Chenery", "Prof Alan Rumsey", "Prof Kim Sterelny", "Dr Paola Escudero", "A/Prof Janet Fletcher", "A/Prof Caroline Jones", "Dr Evan Kidd", "Prof Catherine Travis", "Dr Judith Bishop", "Dr Franklin Chang", "Prof Morten Christiansen", "Prof Greville Corbett", "Prof Russell Gray", "Prof Dr Stephen Levinson", "Prof Elena Lieven", "Prof Miriam Meyerhoff", "Prof Caroline Rowland", "Prof Rena TorresCacoullos", "Dr Jakelin Troy", "A/Prof Bee Ng", "Prof Virginia Yip", "Prof Stephen Matthews"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 28000000, "fundingScheme": "ARC Centres of Excellences", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:26Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:08:04Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/CE140100041", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/CE140100041", "CE140100041"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518499"}]}]}
