In 1983, he was awarded his Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry from the Australian National University and subsequently undertook post-doctoral studies in Biochemistry at the Universities of Oxford and Adelaide. In 1988, John took up a position as Lecturer in Chemistry at the University of Wollongong where he subsequently became an Associate Professor. In early 2004, he returned to the University of Adelaide as Professor of Chemistry and Head of the School of Chemistry & Physics. In 2008, he became the Deputy Executive Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and, for all of 2009, he was also Head of the School of Molecular and Biomedical Science.\u00a0From July 2013 to February 2019, John was Director of the Research School of Chemistry at the Australian National University.

{"description": "In vivo, most proteins only function over a narrow temperature or pH range. For example, if the solution containing a particular protein is heated (stressed), the protein will unfold, aggregate and potentially precipitate. The act of protein precipitation is an irreversible process that, in many cases, has deleterious consequences for cell viability. Protein precipitation is associated with a diversity of diseases, e.g. cataract and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Parkinson's diseases. Nature has evolved cellular mechanisms to minimise protein misfolding, aggregation and precipitation which principally utilise a diverse group of controlling or regulatory proteins called molecular chaperones. Amongst the most important of these are the small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) which are found in all organisms. sHsps function by interacting in a very efficient manner with destabilised proteins to prevent their precipitation. Little is known, however, about the structure of sHsps nor the mechanism by which they perform their chaperone action. This proposal will address these fundamental aspects via the use of a variety of spectroscopic techniques, principally nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.", "title": "Structure-function inter-relationships of small heat-shock chaperone proteins", "id": "100067", "institutions": ["University of Wollongong"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/213112", "researchers": ["Prof John Carver"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 240990, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:41Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:56:44Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Wollongong"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof John Carver"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/213112", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/213112", "213112"], "subjects": ["270199", "Heat shock protein", "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)", "Protein characterization", "Protein structure", "Stress proteins", "Cataract", "Neurological diseases", "Prion diseases", "Protein precipitation", "Stress response"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100067"}]}, {"description": "Cataract arises from clouding of the eye lens due to the aggregation of crystallin proteins whose high concentration and close packing facilitate lens transparency.
