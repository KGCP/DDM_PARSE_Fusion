Computers with multiple processors are now the norm and are used in a wide range of safety, security and mission critical software applications such as transport, health and infrastructure. These multi-core architectures have the potential to lead to important efficiency gains, but can introduce complex and error-prone behaviours that cannot be managed using traditional software development approaches. This project will produce better, scalable and mechanised methods for the design and verification of such software which is expected to reduce the prevalence of failures in efficient, modern software.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190102142", "id": "1378519", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190102142", "researchers": ["Prof Ian Hayes", "Dr Larissa Meinicke", "Prof Dr Cliff Jones", "Dr Peter Hoefner", "Dr Brijesh Dongol"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 460000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:47Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190102142", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190102142", "DP190102142"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378519"}]}]}
