My dissertation focused on the\u00a0representation of race and colonialism in German young adult literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I have recent article publications on\u00a0inclusive and decolonial pedagogy,\u00a0race and gender in German colonial literature, and First World War literature.\u00a0My research interests more broadly are in the areas of\u00a0gender studies,\u00a0critical race theory and critical whiteness studies, and\u00a0postcolonialism and decolonization.\u00a0I come to ANU after previously holding teaching positions at\u00a0Lafayette College (PA), the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Notre Dame (IN).", "project": ["Reading German Whiteness: Race, Gender, and Wilhelmine Youth Culture in a Global Age", "My book project takes up the question of what young people learned about German identity in an era of colonization, racialization, and globalization. In it I examine diverse media produced for young adults\u2014schoolbooks, periodicals, and fiction from authors such as Else Ury, Karl May, and Hans Grimm\u2014in the historical and cultural contexts of the German empire. I begin with the historical roots of modern thinking about race that come from the German intellectual tradition (Kant, Hegel, Herder) and connect it with critical race theory, critical whiteness studies, and feminist theory to show how imperialism and colonialism prompt a rethinking of the relationship of nation, race, and gender and a construction of a white German subjectivity for young readers.\u00a0For example, authors such as May, Friedrich Pajeken, and Sophie W\u00f6rish\u00f6ffer portray German settlers in the American West as racially superior to Native Americans and culturally superior to other white settler groups in order to make a colonial claim to the Americas as a space for a white German future. In the book I offer an understanding of German identity that is both racial and cultural and show how young people were taught to consider themselves as both white and German.", "", "Past Grants and
