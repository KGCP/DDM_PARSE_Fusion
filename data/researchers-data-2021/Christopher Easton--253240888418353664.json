The aims of this project are: to delineate the chemical processes through which these hormones are produced; to develop inhibitors of enzymes involved in hormone production, and agonists and antagonists of receptors through which the hormones act; and to study the ability of the inhibitors, agonists and antagonists to override and bypass the chemical control mechanisms through which hormone levels are usually maintained at homeostasis.
