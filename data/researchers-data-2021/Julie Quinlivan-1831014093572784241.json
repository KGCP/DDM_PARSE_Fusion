The psychological, social and financial cost of adolescent pregnancy in Australia is substantial, in both the long and short term. An unexpected finding in North American studies is that a substantial number of adolescent pregnancies occur by design. Prevention programs in Australia and elsewhere assume adolescents do not wish to become pregnant and focus on educating adolescents about causes rather than consequences. Research conducted by one of us (JAQ) found that over 75% of pregnant teenagers said they had deliberately become pregnant. Another of us (JTC) studied 1,500 Australian adolescents attitudes and beliefs about pregnancy and parenthood. The findings showed high levels of idealisation, especially in males. Males have been largely neglected in adolescent pregnancy research. The first component of this study is a survey of 500 adolescents to investigate their attitudes and beliefs about pregnancy occurring in a sexual partner, and the consequences of that event for them both. The assessment tool is a computer role-play simulation with its starting point the announcement of a pregnancy. The intervention study involves 300 adolescents and comprises viewing and discussing a video in which 4 adolescent males talk about their experiences of the consequences of pregnancy in a sexual partner. The use of 4 groups with different sequences of assessment and intervention will enable us to ascertain the effectiveness of the intervention. Of particular interest is whether the video or the role-play makes any impact on idealised attitudes and beliefs. This research is the first undertaken on adolescent male attitudes and beliefs using a computer role-play. It will provide essential information for the development of effective, male-oriented prevention programs which focus on consequences as well as causes of adolescent pregnancy.", "title": "Adolescent males' beliefs and feelings about the consequences of a partner's pregnancy: a survey and intervention study", "id": "98640", "institutions": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160017", "researchers": ["Prof Alan Russell", "John Condon", "Prof Julie Quinlivan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 170095, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:23Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:46:07Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["John Condon"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160017", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160017", "160017"], "subjects": ["321021", "Adolescent", "Mens health", "Pregnancy", "Contraception", "Mental Health", "Prevention", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98640"}]}, {"description": "Postnatal depression strikes 12-17% of women in the year after giving birth. Postnatal depression can result in emotional, behavioural and developmental problems in children. Although there are many complex psychological and social factors involved, supplementing the diet with an omega-3 fat called DHA has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of depression. Enriching diets with DHA has also been associated with improvements in visual and neural abilities of young infants. Normally, DHA is obtained through the mother's diet and is then passed onto the developing baby whilst in the womb. However, the amount of DHA that is delivered to the baby in pregnancy is high, and in most cases is far higher than most Australian mothers get in their diets. In this study we will test whether supplementing the diets of pregnant women with DHA results in women suffering less depressive symptoms and children with better development scores. If our study is successful, it will result in a simple and effective way to prevent postnatal depression and improve the developmental outcome of the children.", "title": "A Randomised Trial of DHA in Pregnancy to Prevent Postnatal Depressive Symptoms and Enhance Neurodevelopment in Children", "id": "100180", "institutions": ["University of Adelaide"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349301", "researchers": ["Dr Andrew Mcphee", "Prof Maria Makrides", "Prof Robert Gibson", "Prof Julie Quinlivan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 1649000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:50:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:56:48Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Adelaide"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Maria Makrides"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349301", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349301", "349301"], "subjects": ["Clinical Sciences not elsewhere classified", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "child development", "dietary fatty acids", "docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)", "maternal nutrition", "postnatal depression", "nutrition in pregnancy", "pregnancy"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100180"}]}, {"description": "Over 242,000 women give birth annually in Australia and up to 20% experience significant psychological distress in the baby's first year. Severe fatigue, worrying and depression interfere with the development of maternal confidence. If a baby does not sleep well or feed easily or cries for prolonged periods, mothers can feel ineffective and helpless. Assistance early in the baby's life is important to avoid long-term emotional and behavioral problems for mother and child. Nationally, health and social policy focuses on assisting families including those with parental mental health and early parenting problems and children at risk of developmental difficulties. Australia's residential early parenting services are unique, offering brief treatment to mothers with difficulties and infants with unsettled behaviour. Parents are educated in infant care and provided with emotional support and assistance to adjust to the demands of parenting. In past studies by CIA and CIB women reported marked improvements in emotional distress, maternal confidence and infant manageability after completing this treatment and six months later. The education and emotional support were rated as acceptable and very effective. This project is a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate whether brief admission to a residential early parenting service has sustainable benefits for mild to moderate maternal mental health problems and for infant behaviour disturbance. Mothers with a diagnosable mental health condition and with four-month-old infants reported to have unsettled infant behaviour will be randomly assigned to a residential treatment program at an early parenting service or to routine care. Mothers and infants will be assessed with standardized psychological measures one month after treatment and when the baby is one year old. An effective and acceptable intervention will provide an important alternative to available treatments for postnatal psychological disturbance.", "title": "A randomised trial of an early parenting intervention to reduce maternal mood disorder and infant behavior disturbance", "id": "83056", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/454621", "researchers": ["A/Pr Lyle Gurrin", "Prof Jane Fisher", "Dr Heather Rowe", "Prof Julie Quinlivan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 390503.84, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:54:41Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:48:03Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Jane Fisher"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/454621", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/454621", "454621"], "subjects": ["Mental Health", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "Infant Behaviour", "Maternal Mental Health", "Maternal and Child Health", "Mother-Infant Relationship", "Parent Management Strategies", "Infant Development", "Intervention Study", "Maternal Depression", "Parenting", "Psychological and Psychosocial Adjustment"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/83056"}]}, {"description": "The most significant perinatal problem in the world today is early preterm birth with its consequent threat to life and life-long health in survivors.
