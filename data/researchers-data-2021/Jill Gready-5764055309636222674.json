Our work is focussed on problems - both plant and animal - with a pathway to translating findings into treatments or products for social and economic good.Our research approaches use conceptual biology to solve complex problems by integrating  existing knowledge to develop novel models for test in silico, in  vitro and in planta. We also use our particular strengths in computational biology, both biomolecular simulation and modelling and bioinformatics, to forge innovative couplings of computation and experiment.
