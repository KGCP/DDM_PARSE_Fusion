Consequently, one of the Country s National Health Priorities is to improve our understanding of this condition. Analyses of the asthmatic lung reveal an airway wall that is thickened, an airway lumen that is obstructed and abnormal spasmogenicity of the airway smooth muscle: processes that collectively contribute to both acute and chronic respiratory dysfunction. Asthmatics develop an immune response that is biased toward production of allergy-related T helper 2 cytokines of which interleukin (IL)-13 is a potent mediator of disease. However, the molecular processes linking IL-13 with abnormal airway wall changes are unclear. To identify previously uncharacterised IL-13-related molecules, we used a protein profiling approach that identified a novel lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) termed Ym2, which is secreted abundantly into the airway fluid of mice in which allergic airways disease has been induced. Preliminary studies suggest that Ym2 is an intermediary of IL-13 that is involved in respiratory dysfunction. This project aims to work out how Ym2 interacts with the molecules and cells of the respiratory tract to regulate allergic disease. Specific inhibitors of Ym2 will be developed to examine what happens to allergic responses when Ym2 can t function; transgenic mice will be developed to determine if we see features of allergy when Ym2 is over-expressed in the normal lung, and human samples will be screened to identify the human counterpart of Ym2 and whether this counterpart is secreted into the lung fluid of asthmatics. Defining the mechanism by which Ym2 regulates the pathogenesis of allergic disease will not only contribute to our basic understanding of the processes underlying asthma pathology, but also generate new information for better design of therapeutics directed against specific mediators of this debilitating and widespread disease.", "title": "Functional analysis of the Ym2 chitinase-like lectin in allergic airways disease", "id": "98427", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366765", "researchers": ["Dr Dianne Webb", "Prof Rakesh Kumar", "A/Pr Marco Casarotto"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 283767.62, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:51:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:58Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Dr Dianne Webb"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366765", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366765", "366765"], "subjects": ["Allergy", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "IMMUNOLOGY", "asthma", "carbohydrates", "eosinophils", "murine model", "transgenic mice", "airway remodelling", "allergic airway disease", "bronchoconstriction", "extracellular matrix", "lung inflammation"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98427"}]}, {"description": "The project has implications for neuromuscular diseases and for muscle weakness in general and in the elderly, all of which are significant health issues. The results will elucidate molecular mechanisms in muscle contraction and will provide a basis for drug design and treatment of muscle disorders. Respiration and locomotion depend on changes in calcium concentration inside muscle cells. Cardiovascular function, neuronal activity and immune responses also depend on the release of calcium from internal stores. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channels, either alone or in combination with a different internal calcium channel, regulate calcium release in each of these diverse functions. The essential nature of RyRs is underlined by death at or before birth when RyR expression is defective. Genetic defects in the RyR cause cardiac arrhythmias, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. RyR function is compromised in heart failure and fatigue. The key role of RyRs makes them a potential therapeutic target, but they are not used as such because of the limited knowledge of the nature and structure of their regulatory sites. Electrical signals from the brain are able to release calcium from internal stores in muscle and initiate muscle contraction by virtue of a physical interaction between two calcium channel proteins, a surface membrane channel and the RyR. The molecular basis of this protein-protein interaction is is not understood and is a subject of this proposal. We will (a) solve the structure of one part of the surface channel that is known to contribute to the protein-protein interaction with the RyR, (b) determine the amino acid residues that interact with each other and (c) evaluate the functional consequences of the the binding of proteins.

The ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channel regulates changes in calcium concentrations inside the muscle cell that are essential for respiration and movement. Defects in expression of RyRs results in death in utero or at birth. The RyR is also important in many other tissues, where it acts either alone or in combination with a second type of calcium channel, to regulate the changes in the concentrations of calcium ions within the cell, which are essential for a variety of processes including cardiac contraction, vascular constriction, neuronal activity and immune responses. Despite its importance, little is known about the regulation of the RyR channel opening during contraction in skeletal muscle or the mechanisms of ion movement through its pore. It is often difficult to define the specific role of RyRs in intact tissues because of the lack of specific probes for the channel. The RyR is an obvious target for therapeutic drugs to modify muscle contraction, but has not been used as such because of the lack of specific and reversible drugs. Muscle performance is reduced, and fatigue is rapid, in neuromuscular disease. Performance can be improved by variety of drugs like anabolic steroids which unfortunately have additional adverse actions. The aims of the project are (a) to discover more about the regulation of, and ion conduction pathway through, the skeletal muscle RyR channel, (b) to identify compounds that can be used as specific probes for RyR activity and (c) to identify compounds that might in the future provide the basis for development of the RyR as a therapeutic target.", "title": "SPECIFIC MODIFICATION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE RYANODINE RECEPTOR ACTIVITY", "id": "76168", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224237", "researchers": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty", "Prof Graham Lamb", "A/Pr Marco Casarotto"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 411000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:13Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224237", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224237", "224237"], "subjects": ["320502", "calcium signalling", "ligand binding sites", "peptide activators and inhibitors", "ryanodine receptors", "specific RyR modulators", "central core disease", "fatigue", "malignant hyperthermia", "muscle weakness", "neuromuscular disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76168"}]}, {"description": "Sepsis is a major clinical problem that causes more deaths in Australia than breast, prostate or colon cancer.
