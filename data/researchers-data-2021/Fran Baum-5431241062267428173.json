It will specifically take into account the impact of social and economic factors on health. More particularly, the research will consider how Indigenous people's patterns of social interaction, trust and reciprocity - elements of social capital - affect their perceived health status. The research will examine the extent to which people are able to use their social networks to gain access to benefits such as assistance in daily life, access to jobs or to people with influence in ways that directly or indirectly contribute to improved health within the Indigenous population. The impact of racism on health will also be considered. The research will be conducted in two high income and three low income suburbs in Adelaide in order to allow comparisons between the suburbs and between Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents in each. Information will be collected from detailed interviews, a face-to-face survey and observation of the social environment, services and facilities available in the case study suburbs. The final stage of the research will engage policy makers and program planners to determine the implications of the research for their work.

Relationships have also been found between an individual's income and their health. It is not clear, however, which has the greatest influence on health difference - characteristics of the areas themselves or the type of people living in the area. Recent research has suggested that the levels of social capital (that is, links between people, the amount of voluntary community activity, and the degree to which people trust others and civic institutions) has a significant impact on health. The nature of physical environments also has an impact on peoples' lives. The study will examine how the communities in which people live influence their health and will consider both aspects of the physical and social environments of areas, and their demographic composition. The research is in three stages. The first stage involves a telephone survey of residents of metropolitan Adelaide and includes questions about social capital, area of residence and health. Existing information about areas, such as crime rates, availability of services and air and water pollution, will be collected. The second stage involves detailed case studies of four suburbs in Adelaide, two of which are more affluent than average and two of which are poorer than average. These case studies will: catalogue the facilities available; survey a random sample of residents about their health, their participation in community activities and their perceptions of their area; talk about these issues in detail with residents in each area; and assess the quality of the physical environment. In the third stage, the findings of the research will be discussed with community members and key policy makers in state and local government to determine how communities can be best structured so that they support individuals' health status.", "title": "Urban locational disadvantage and health: compositional and contextual determinants", "id": "97197", "institutions": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/229913", "researchers": ["A/Pr Anna Ziersch", "Dr Christine Putland", "A/Pr Andrew Beer", "Prof Fran Baum"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 608050, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:55Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:44:59Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Fran Baum"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/229913", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/229913", "229913"], "subjects": ["321299", "Community health", "Environmental influences", "Health inequalities", "Policy development", "Social determinants of health", "Healthy urban environments", "Locational and social disadvantage", "Socio economic variations in health status"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97197"}]}, {"description": "This research will develop and implement a program logic evaluation in order to assess the effectiveness of various models of primary heatlh care service delivery.
