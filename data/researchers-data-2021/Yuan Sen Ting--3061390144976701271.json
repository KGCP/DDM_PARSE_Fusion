Our work draws heavily on a combination of theoretical modeling, statistical inferences, and machine learning which leads to innovative angles that shed light on the most fundamental questions of star formation, galactic evolution, the interstellar medium, and cosmology.I primarily work on the Milky Way, capitalizing on a wide range of on-going large-scale surveys and most key future surveys in the next decade, including spectroscopy (SDSS-V, DESI, GALAH, H3, APOGEE, LAMOST, JWST), astrometry (Gaia), photometry (DES, LSST, Euclid, WFIRST) and asteroseismology (TESS, PLATO). I am an \"end-to-end\" large survey scientist. I develop novel methods to maximally harness information in the data, build theoretical models, and confront them with observation via statistical inference."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [], "ANDS-Grants": []}
