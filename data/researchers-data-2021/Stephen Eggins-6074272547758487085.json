At ANU I developed novel ICPMS methods to make precise and accurate analysis of trace elements in basalts and mantle samples. The expertise in ICPMS then provided the foundation for developing the ANU's world leading HelEx laser ablation ICPMS technology in partnership with Michael Shelley and Les Kinsley. We pioneered the use of deep UV 193nm wavelengths, He as the ablation medium, and the two volume ablation cell design that has become widely adopted by manufacturers and research labroatories around the world. I have since focused on applying LA-ICPMS in novel ways to problems in environmental geochemistry, dating and reconstruction, and broader research in the area marine biogeochemistry and biomineralization, in particular with the goal of understanding fundamental\u00a0 biomineralisation processes in marine calcifiers (especially foraminifera). I am particularly interested in how biomineralisation processes influence the incorporation of geochemical and isotopic proxies in the skeletons and shells of corals, molluscs and foraminifera and how this influences past ocean and climate reconstructions.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Variable mafic recharge across a caldera cycle at Rabaul, Papua New Guinea", "year": "2020", "source": "Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, vol. 393, pp. 1-11", "authors": ["Fabbro G", "McKee C", "Sindang M", "Stephen Eggins"]}, {"title": "Constraining multiple controls on planktic foraminifera Mg/Ca", "year": "2020", "source": "Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, vol. 273, pp. 116-136", "authors": ["Holland K", "Branson O", "Haynes L", "Stephen Eggins"]}, {"title": "Dating the skull from Broken Hill, Zambia, and its position in human evolution", "year": "2020", "source": "Nature, vol. 580, no. 7803, pp. 372-375", "authors": ["Grun R", "Pike A", "McDermott F", "Stephen Eggins"]}, {"title": "Micro-characterisation of cassiterite by geology, texture and zonation: A case study of the Karagwe Ankole Belt, Rwanda", "year": "2020", "source": "Ore Geology Reviews, vol. 124", "authors": ["Nambaje C", "Yaxley G", "Stephen Eggins"]}, {"title": "LAtools: A data analysis package for the reproducible reduction of LA-ICPMS data", "year": "2019", "source": "Chemical Geology, vol. 504, pp. 83-95", "authors": ["Branson O", "Fehrenbacher J", "Vetter L", "Stephen Eggins"]}, {"title": "Who", "year": "2019", "source": "s been using my burial mound?
