Her research has focused on conducting trials of automated,  online therapy programs targeting depression and anxiety disorders. \u00a0As a  clinically-trained researcher, Dr Farrer is interested in the  intersection of technology, clinical service delivery, and research, namely,  exploring different methods of supporting users of digital interventions,  examining factors that predict response and adherence to these programs,  and investigating models of disseminating and implementing  online interventions in different settings. She is also interested in the mental health of university students, having recently completed a project funded by the Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre to develop and evaluate a virtual mental health clinic designed specifically for tertiary student populations (The Uni Virtual Clinic).", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Development of the Uni Virtual Clinic: an online programme for improving the mental health of university students", "year": "2020", "source": "British Journal of Guidance and Counselling, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 333-346", "authors": ["Lou Farrer", "Gulliver A", "Katruss N"]}, {"title": "What prevents young adults from seeking help?
