We have identified loci governing the response to leishmaniasis and malaria. However the major focus of the laboratory is on trying to identify new drugs to combat malaria. By using the example of natural mutations that affect the red cell and making it difficult for the parasite to grow, we have found genes, that when mutated, prevent growth of malarial parasites. These genetic changes point the way to the creation of a new type of treatment that will be steadfast against the development of drug resistance.Our laboratory is also interested in the genetic susceptibility to other diseases of humans.

Activation or deletion of these genes can have profound effects on the control of cell growth and result in tumours. Many tumour suppressor genes give carriers an elevated risk of disease. However in many cases the incidence of these mutations causing cancer is much lower than would be expected, due to other influencing factors. This project aims to try and understand the reasons behind this in a mouse model of cancer, plasmacytomas. Modifers of tumour incidence are proposed for human disease but very little is known about the identity of the genes involved or in the biological pathways regulating tumour incidence. The search for these genes in humans is difficult. We have begun studies to find modifiers of tumourigenesis using the E -v-abl transgenic model of plasmacytomas. This is the mouse equivalent of multiple myeloma. Studies have shown that some strains of mice have markedly different incidences of tumours. C57BL-6 animals are less susceptible with 20% of animals developing tumour by 12 months of age. In contrast, 90% of transgenic animals on the BALB-c background develop tumour by 12 months of age.

This structure is analogous to a light globe under a lampshade. Just as one can change the nature of the lamplight by changing the lampshade, one can change the Quantum Dot emitted light by changing the surface of the microsphere. Since the scale is so small (each microsphere is about the size of a single bacterial cell), the amount and nature of the material needed to bind to the surface to effect a detectable change is also very small, on the order of just of few tens or hundreds of molecules. This project seeks to exploit this principle to create a new class of ultra sensitive detector which can be used in many sorts of applications such as medical diagnostics and biosensing.", "title": "Q-Sand (TM): Whispering Gallery Mode Detection System For Ultrasensitive and Label Free Testing in Biotechnology.", "id": "98931", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/359293", "researchers": ["Prof Paul Mulvaney", "Prof Simon Foote"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 127750, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Development Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:51:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:46:22Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Paul Mulvaney"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/359293", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/359293", "359293"], "subjects": ["Aged Care Nursing", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "NURSING", "Diagnostics", "Microspheres", "Nanotechnology", "Quantum Dots", "Whispering Gallery Modes"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98931"}]}, {"description": "This grant is for a Phase II clinical trial to test an FDA &amp; TGA approved drug for a new use as an antimalarial drug.
