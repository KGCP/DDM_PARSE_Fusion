This is serious issue not only in terms of financial losses, but also when considering food security and stability. As an example, the Table below outlines losses on Australian wheat farms to disease. The top 4 diseases in terms of losses are caused by fungal pathogens (based on 2008 prices). Using today's wheat prices, the losses from fungi in Australia exceed $1 billion dollars, and that is using effective control measures; without these losses would exceed $5 billion dollars. Thus there are many good reasons to better understand how these pathogens cause disease!Wheat Disease$/ha AUDTotal losses($M\u00a0AUD)yellow spot17.82212stripe rust10.62127septoria nodorum blotch9.07108crown rot6.6379Pratylenchus neglectus6.1373Total losses from others26.37314Total present loss76.94913\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How do these pathgoens cause disease?Our laboratory focuses on two significant pathogens of wheat.\u00a0Stagonospora nodorum\u00a0is a fungus that causes leaf and glume blotch disease on wheat (septoria nodorum blotch). This disease causes greater than $100 million dollars in yield losses per annum in Australia alone and has been recently ranked as the third most important disease of wheat in this country. Traditional breeding methods for disease controls have only been partially successful at best and new and innovative anti-fungal strategies are required to prevent disease and secure Australian and global wheat supplies in the future.Not only is\u00a0S. nodorum\u00a0a threat to global food security, its also extremely interesting and versatile to work with!\u00a0S. nodorum\u00a0can be cultured in the lab and is amenable to many common genetic techniques such as targeted gene disruption and gene overexpression. The genome sequence has been completed and extensive proteomics and metabolomics resources have been developed making\u00a0S. nodorum\u00a0a perfect model pathogen to better understand plant-pathogen interactions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The second wheat pathogen we study in the lab is\u00a0Zymoseptoria tritici.\u00a0Z. tritici\u00a0is the most important pathogen of wheat in Europe, the region that produces one-fifth of the world's wheat supply.\u00a0Zymospetoria tritici\u00a0is a fungal pathogen of wheat related to\u00a0Stagonospora nodorum, and is the causal agent of the most important wheat disease in Europe (septoria tritici blotch). This single disease alone is responsible for greater than $1 billion dollars in losses each year. The disease is particualrly problematic in that natural sources of resistance are difficult to source and the pathogen is very adept at rapidly evolving fungicide resistance.\u00a0Interestingly, the disease isn't currently a major problem in Australia. There are many postualted reasons for this including the possibility that European isolates of the pathogen have evolved to be more aggressive. Fortuantely, Australian quaratine has prevented these isolates from entering Australia however the pathogen remains a serious biosecurity risk.Our lab is studying all aspects of the above diseases with a focus implementing this improved undersantding to facilitate new and novel disease management strategies.\u00a0Fungi synthesize an amazing range of novel and active compounds!Another research area in the lab is focused on understadning fungal secondary metabolism and idenitfying novel metabolites. Fungal secondary metabolites are amongst the biologically active compunds on the earth and are part of our dailey lives, for good or bad ... . For example, its almost impossible to count how many lives penicillin has saved. More recently, statin-based drugs have an enourmous impact of many peoples lives in terms of cholesterol control. However, not all these compounds are benenfical. Many fungi produce compounds that are lethal. Aflatoxin is the worst carcinogenic toxin produced in nature whilst a variety of palant pathogenic fungi produce mycotoxins that render the plant useless to eat (for humans or animals). And who can forget death cap mushrooms!Our lab has multiple projects available from everything including determining the relevance of these secondary metabolite compounds on plant disease to isolating new compounds as novel bioactives."], "biography": "", "project": ["", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Transposon-Mediated Horizontal Transfer of the Host-Specific Virulence Protein ToxA between Three Fungal Wheat Pathogens", "year": "2019", "source": "mBio, vol. 10, no. 5, pp. 1-22", "authors": ["McDonald M", "Taranto A", "Hill E", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Have we finally opened the door to understanding Septoria tritici blotch disease in wheat?", "year": "2017", "source": "New Phytologist, vol. 214, no. 2, pp. 493-495", "authors": ["Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Production of small cysteine-rich effector proteins in Escherichia coli for structural and functional studies", "year": "2017", "source": "Molecular Plant Pathology, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 141-151", "authors": ["Zhang X", "Nguyen N", "Breen S", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Fungal phytopathogens encode functional homologues of plant rapid alkalinisation factor (RALF) peptides", "year": "2017", "source": "Molecular Plant Pathology, vol. 18, no. 6, pp. 811-824", "authors": ["Thynne E", "Saur I", "Simbaqueba J", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Wheat PR-1 proteins are targeted by necrotrophic pathogen effector proteins", "year": "2016", "source": "The Plant Journal, vol. 88, no. 1, pp. 13-25", "authors": ["Breen S", "Williams S", "Winterberg B", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Differential effector gene expression underpins epistasis in a plant fungal disease", "year": "2016", "source": "The Plant Journal, vol. 87, no. 4, pp. 343-354", "authors": ["Phan H", "Rybak K", "Furuki E", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Wheat PR-1 proteins are targeted by necrotrophic pathogen effector proteins", "year": "2016", "source": "The Plant Journal, vol. 88, no. 1, pp. 13-25", "authors": ["Breen S", "Williams S", "Winterberg B", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Utilizing gene tree variation to identify candidate effector genes in Zymoseptoria tritici", "year": "2016", "source": "G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 779-791", "authors": ["McDonald M", "McGinness L", "Hane J", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Production of small cysteine-rich effector proteins in Escherichia coli for structural and functional studies", "year": "2016", "source": "Molecular Plant Pathology, vol. online preprint, pp. (11 pp)", "authors": ["Zhang X", "Nguyen N", "Breen S  Williams SJ (", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Recent Advances in the Zymoseptoria tritici-wheat interaction: insights from pathogenomics", "year": "2015", "source": "Frontiers in Plant Science, vol. 6, no. 2015, pp. 102-102", "authors": ["McDonald M", "McDonald B", "Peter Solomon"]}, {"title": "Dissecting the role of G-protein signalling in primary metabolism in the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum", "year": "2013", "source": "Microbiology (UK), vol. 159, no.

characterise a new disease resistance pathway. By focusing on the interaction between key plant and pathogen proteins, this proposal seeks to advance the understanding of how the pathogen causes disease. The expected outcomes from these advances include the generation of new tools to manage plant diseases whilst building strong international collaborations. This project should provide significant benefits for generating new leads for plant disease management leading to enhanced food security.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180102355", "id": "1316521", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102355", "researchers": ["A/Prof Peter Solomon"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 363164, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:42Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:34Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102355", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102355", "DP180102355"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1316521"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to investigate how a fungal plant pathogen makes and uses small bioactive molecules to facilitate infection.
