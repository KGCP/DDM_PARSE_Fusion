generate new knowledge on how to influence public policy in order to reduce the supply and consumption of a health-harming commodity, ultra-processed foods.

Expected outcomes include strategies for pursuing these different actors&rsquo; interests and evidence that can help institutions to promote better policies. Intended benefits include better nutrition outcomes in Australia, Thailand and Fiji.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100576", "id": "1378247", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100576", "researchers": ["Prof Sharon Friel", "Dr Anne Marie Thow", "Dr Ashley Schram", "Dr Carmen Huckel Schneider", "Prof Jeff Collin", "Dr SIRINYA PHULKERD", "Dr Jillian Wate"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 393000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100576", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100576", "DP190100576"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378247"}]}]}
