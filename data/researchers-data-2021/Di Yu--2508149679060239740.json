While immune deficiency leads to susceptibility to infections and cancers, the trade-off of \u201cstrong\u201d immune responses is the risk of autoimmune diseases and inflammation. Maintenance of a competent but balanced immune system is the cornerstone of health. The sophisticated immune defence mechanisms are essentially orchestrated by T cells. Not only can T cells directly kill infected and cancerous cells, but they also, through multiple subsets, fundamentally control the activation and function of other immune cell types. Therefore, targeted regulation of T cells subsets can efficiently modulate immune responses to treat many human diseases.In the lab of T-cell Immune Mechanism, Monitoring and Modulation (TIM3), Dr Di Yu and his team are investigating the molecular mechanisms by which T cells control the competence and balance of the immune system, with the aim to design new strategies to modulate the immune system to treat autoimmune disease, infection and cancer.Three major approaches are used in our research. First, we use gene-targeted mice to investigate basic molecular mechanisms of the adaptive immunity, particularly for T cells and cytokines. Second, we phenotype immune cells using methods such as multi-colour flow cytometry to monitor the immune system of patients to understand the dysregulated immune responses associated with diseases and the immunological changes responding to therapies. Third, based on biochemical and structural knowledge of cytokines, we design and optimize cytokine-based immunotherapies to modulate the immune system to treat human diseases."], "biography": "",

Diminished antibody responses lead to immunodeficiency while excessive antibody responses contribute to autoimmune diseases. We are studying a newly identified specialised helper T cell subset, termed follicular helper T cells, which is essential to regulate the high-affinity and long-lived antibody responses.
