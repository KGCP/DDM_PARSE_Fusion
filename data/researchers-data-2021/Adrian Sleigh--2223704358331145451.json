Development-related 'health transition' can be optimised if there is information on new causes of disease - immediate risk factors, and 'upstream' economic, cultural and environmental influences. The team will study this health-risk transition in the whole Thai population - looking back 50 years, then forwards in 100,000 Sukothai Thammathirat Open University students living all over Thailand and followed for four years. The team will map changing risks and upstream influences, produce information for Thai preventive programs, boost regional research capacity, create a regional partnership, and support PhD and postdoctoral training.", "title": "Thai health-risk transition: a national cohort study", "id": "82151", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268055", "researchers": ["Dr Bruce Caldwell", "A/Pr Jane Dixon", "Dr Boonchai Somboonsook", "Prof Nuchjaree Kamolsukudom", "Dr Tippawan Prapamontol", "Dr Lynette Lim", "Ms Duangkae Vilainerun", "Prof Adrian Sleigh", "Ms Suwanee Khamman", "Prof Anthony Mcmichael", "A/Pr Sam-Ang Seubsman", "E/Pr Tord Kjellstrom"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 1231214.8, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:11Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:25Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Adrian Sleigh"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268055", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268055", "268055"], "subjects": ["321202", "Thailand", "cohort study", "health-risk transition"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82151"}]}]}
