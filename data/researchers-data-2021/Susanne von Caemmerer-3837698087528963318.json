Dramatic improvements in microscope hardware and software and in the range of fluorescent markers used to tag selected cellular components now provide new and exciting opportunities to localise and determine the function of ions and molecules not only in preserved samples but also, most excitingly, in living cells. The proposed multiphoton confocal microscope will allow researchers in Canberra to obtain high quality images of static and moving components in living cells and tissues and will facilitate the discovery of new knowledge that contributes to our understanding and control of development and disease in both plants and animals.", "title": "Multiphoton confocal microscope", "id": "74664", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE100100078", "researchers": ["Hardham Prof Adrienne R", "Prof Kiaran Kirk", "Prof Stefan Broer", "Prof Susanne Von Caemmerer", "Dr Ulrike Mathesius", "Dr Peter S Solomon", "Dr Josette Masle", "Dr Kevin J Saliba", "Prof Barry J Pogson", "Prof Christopher R Parish", "Dr Owen K Atkin", "Prof Suresh Mahalingam"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 600000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2010, "endDate": 2010, "dateTimeModified": "2015-08-13T17:16:05Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:36:03Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE100100078", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE100100078", "LE100100078"], "subjects": ["BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "advanced light microscopy", "cell biology", "molecular biology", "protein-protein interactions"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/74664"}]}]}
