Abnormal bone resorption contributes to most of these diseases and conditions. Based on the clinical evidence of P62 mutation in patients with Paget's Disease of bone and our observation of the involvement of P62 in RANKL-induced NF-Kb signaling, we propose that intracellular molecule P62-A172 may play an important part in the switch off-on signals necessary for bone resorbing cells to resorb bone. To this end, we will study the molecular mechanism of P62 in action, and the interaction with its possible partners for the facilitation of abnormal bone resorption. The clinical significance of this project is to: 1) enhance understanding of abnormal bone resorption in Orthopaedic related diseases and conditions. 2) provide a strategy of drug development for the treatment of these disease and conditions.", "title": "The Role of P62/A170 in Pathological Bone Destruction", "id": "94831", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/353673", "researchers": ["Prof Minghao Zheng", "Dr Lin Huang", "Prof Jiake Xu"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 276000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:51:21Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:21Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Minghao Zheng"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/353673", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/353673", "353673"], "subjects": ["Orthopaedics", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Fracture", "NF-KB activation", "Osteoclast", "P62", "Pathological bone destruction", "Age-related skeleton disorders", "Aseptic bone loosening", "Giant cell tumour of bone", "Osteoporosis", "Paget's disease of bone"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94831"}]}]}
