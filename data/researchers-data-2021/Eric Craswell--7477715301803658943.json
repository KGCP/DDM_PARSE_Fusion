He has worked on nitrogen cycling and fertilizer efficiency for rice and wheat at research institutions in Queensland, the United States, United Kingdom, the Philippines, and Austria. He has spent an extended period working on land and water resources management in developing countries, including 13 years in Canberra as Research Programme Co-ordinator at the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, and five years in Bangkok as Director General of the International Board for Soil Research and Management. In 2002-2004 he led an AusAID-funded project supporting the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute in Phnom Penh. His last full-time position was for three years as Executive Officer of the Global Water System Project at the University of Bonn, Germany.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "n overview of the role and significance of 15N methodologies in quantifying biological N2 fixation (BNF) and BNF dynamics in agro-ecosystems", "year": "2018", "source": "Symbiosis, vol. 75, no. 1, pp. 1-16pp", "authors": ["Chalk P", "Eric Craswell"]}, {"title": "Fate and efficiency of 15N-labelled slow- and controlled-release fertilizers", "year": "2015", "source": "Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, vol. 102, no. 2, pp. 167-178", "authors": ["Chalk P", "Eric Craswell", "Polidoro J"]}, {"title": "On the usage of absolute (x) and relative (d) values of 15N abundance", "year": "2015", "source": "Soil Biology and Biochemistry, vol. 85, pp. 51-53", "authors": ["Chalk P", "Inacio C", "Eric Craswell"]}, {"title": "Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils: Separating the muck from the magic", "year": "2014", "source": "International Symposium on Managing Soils for Food Security and Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rome Italy, pp. 199-204", "authors": ["Eric Craswell", "King H", "Read Z"]}, {"title": "Book Review: Rainwater Harvesting for Agriculture in the Dry Areas", "year": "2013", "source": "Experimental Agriculture, vol. 49, no. 1, pp. 1pp", "authors": ["Eric Craswell"]}, {"title": "Mining of Nutrients in African Soils Due to Agricultural Intensification", "year": "2013", "source": "in Rattan Lal and B.A. Stewart (ed.), Principles of Sustainable Soil Management in Agroecosystems, CRC Press, Florida USA, pp. 401-422", "authors": ["Eric Craswell", "Vlek P"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2013", "source": "Doing Well by Doing Good: International Agricultural Research - How it benefits Australia as well as developing countries", "authors": ["Blight D", "Eric Craswell", "Mullen J"]}, {"title": "Erosion control: Soil conservation", "year": "2012", "source": "in Sven Erik Jorgensen (ed.), Encyclopedia of Environmental Management, CRC Press LLC, pp. 1072-1080", "authors": ["Eric Craswell"]}, {"title": "Peak phosphorus - Implications for soil productivity and global food security", "year": "2010", "source": "World Congress of Soil Science 2010, ed.
