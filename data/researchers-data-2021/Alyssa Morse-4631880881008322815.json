Using\u00a0grounded\u00a0theory\u00a0methods, the project aims to understand the nature of consumer and carer participation in health services and policy in the ACT, including recent changes in the participatory environment and the responses to those changes. It will determine what existing mechanisms are used in the ACT to demonstrate how consumer and carer participation is impacting on policy and services. Finally, the project will explore the concept of \u2018value\u2019, investigating how consumer and carer voices are valued and the meaning of \u2018value\u2019 in the participatory environment from multiple stakeholder perspectives. These concepts will be explored in a series of interviews\u00a0with lived experience representatives, policy makers and service providers\u00a0and a multi-stakeholder\u00a0roundtable. The ultimate goal of the project is to create a set of\u00a0consumer- and carer-developed principles for participation, value and impact, and an accompanying set of indicators to be used by the health sector for measurement.", "This project is funded by an RSPH\u00a0Excellence in Population Health Research Award.", "Whose story is it?", "This project explored mental health consumer and carer perspectives on procedural research ethics and shared story-telling in research settings.
