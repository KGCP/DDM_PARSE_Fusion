This work includes ACIAR-supported research in Lao PDR and Vietnam, with precursors in Australia and globally; and work with The Forest Dialogue's Tree Plantations in the Landscape initiative;education in forestry, environment and society, and sustainability.I also engage with a wider range of research topics, principally those pursued by the PhD and Masters scholars whom I supervise.My publications list illustrates aspects of my work in each of these topic areas."], "biography": "Peter received the Vice-Chancellor's Award for Community Outreach 2011 and was co-recipient of the Vice-Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Supervision 2016.
