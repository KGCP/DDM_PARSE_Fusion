He obtained his PhD from Heidelberg University on the development of anti-infectives against dengue virus in 2014, for which he was awarded the PhD prize for medicinal chemistry by the German Chemical Society (2015). He has since worked as a Feodor Lynen Fellow (Alexander von Humboldt Foundation) at the Australian National University (2015\u20132018) and as a Rising Star Fellow at the Free University of Berlin (2018\u20132019). In 2019, he received a Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) from the Australian Research Council to start his independent research endeavours on medicinal chemistry and bioconjugation at the Research School of Chemistry at the ANU, where he was appointed Senior Lecturer in 2020.", "project": ["Development of antiviral agents", "Selective therapeutic agents are needed to combat epidemic outbreaks of neglected tropical diseases caused by viruses such as Chikungunya, dengue or Zika and pandemics like the one caused by\u00a0SARS-CoV-2. Our research targets viral proteases as the Achilles heel of viral replication. We design selective probes and inhibitors that help to characterise and validate proteases as antiviral drug targets and develop lead compounds for drug discovery campaigns.", "Biocompatible peptide modifications", "Macrocyclic and modified peptides are considered next generation therapeutics, as they combine\u00a0the properties of smaller drugs and larger antibodies. We are developing new chemical tools to cyclise and modify peptides under biocompatible conditions. This allows us to perform peptide modifications directly in presence of potential drug targets to screen for peptides with improved properties.", "New technologies for drug discovery", "The generation of new drug candidates requires the identification and optimisation of compounds that bind specifically to drug targets. This process is usually conducted in a multi-step linear manner. Our research aims to short-circuit the generation of such compounds by developing novel screening methods that simultaneously report the compound binding event, site and orientation on the target.", "Bioorthogonal chemical reactions", "Chemical ligation reactions that do not interfere with biological systems are essential to tag and probe proteins. Modern genetic engineering enables the site-specific incorporation of over 100 different unnatural amino acids. We introduce new unnatural amino acids that allow for orthogonal bioconjugation and selective protein tagging. We are also interested in reversible protein modification using the unique binding characteristics of underexplored chemical elements."], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "crystal structure of zika virus ns2b ns3 protease in complex with a boronate inhibitor", "year": 2016, "source": "science", "authors": [{"name": "jian lei", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}, {"name": "guido hansen", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}, {"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "christian d klein", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "l zhang", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}, {"name": "rolf hilgenfeld", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}], "id": 3880285}, {"title": "the sars cov 2 main protease as drug target", "year": 2020, "source": "bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters", "authors": [{"name": "sven ullrich", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "australian national university"}], "id": 30970080}, {"title": "the medicinal chemistry of dengue virus", "year": 2016, "source": "journal of medicinal chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "mira a m behnam", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "boldescu", "affiliation": "academy of sciences of moldova"}, {"name": "christian d klein", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}], "id": 162030435}, {"title": "promiscuity and selectivity in covalent enzyme inhibition a systematic study of electrophilic fragments", "year": 2014, "source": "journal of medicinal chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "christian jost", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "christoph nitsche"}, {"name": "therese scholz"}, {"name": "lionel roux"}, {"name": "christian d klein"}], "id": 162030435}, {"title": "biocompatible macrocyclization between cysteine and 2 cyanopyridine generates stable peptide inhibitors", "year": 2019, "source": "organic letters", "authors": [{"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "hideki onagi", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "junping quek", "affiliation": "nanyang technological university"}, {"name": "gottfried otting", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "dahai luo", "affiliation": "nanyang technological university"}, {"name": "thomas huber", "affiliation": "australian national university"}], "id": 201989124}, {"title": "peptide boronic acid inhibitors of flaviviral proteases medicinal chemistry and structural biology", "year": 2017, "source": "journal of medicinal chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "l zhang", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}, {"name": "lena f weigel", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "jonas schilz", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}, {"name": "dominik graf", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "ralf bartenschlager", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "rolf hilgenfeld", "affiliation": "university of lubeck"}, {"name": "christian d klein", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}], "id": 162030435}, {"title": "thiazolidinone peptide hybrids as dengue virus protease inhibitors with antiviral activity in cell culture", "year": 2013, "source": "journal of medicinal chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "verena n schreier"}, {"name": "mira a m behnam"}, {"name": "anil kumar"}, {"name": "ralf bartenschlager"}, {"name": "christian d klein"}], "id": 162030435}, {"title": "pseudocontact shifts in biomolecular nmr using paramagnetic metal tags", "year": 2017, "source": "progress in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "authors": [{"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "gottfried otting", "affiliation": "australian national university"}], "id": 11006672}, {"title": "aqueous microwave assisted one pot synthesis of n substituted rhodanines", "year": 2013, "source": "cheminform", "authors": [{"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "christian d klein", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}], "id": 41354064}, {"title": "aqueous microwave assisted one pot synthesis of n substituted rhodanines", "year": 2012, "source": "tetrahedron letters", "authors": [{"name": "christoph nitsche", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}, {"name": "christian d klein", "affiliation": "heidelberg university"}], "id": 133942674}], "ANDS-Grants": [{"description": "This project aims to establish a tool to accelerate lead generation from very small molecules.

The new approach is expected to facilitate identification and development of new lead molecules, drawing on advances made in the field of fragment-based lead discovery, which is increasingly used in the pharmaceutical industries. The tools developed can also be applied for imaging of biological processes.
