For some the industry can transform and safeguard national energy sources and fuel booming Asian exports. For others it damages both the environment and communities. This tension is vividly expressed by local protests and regulatory bans. Communities, mining companies and government invoke a 'social licence to operate' as fundamental to industry viability. This landmark project explores the concept of a social licence to operate in Australia's CSG industry to tease apart the dynamic risks, opportunities and tensions at work between corporations, rural and regional Australian communities and government, and offers policy and practice recommendations.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140102779", "id": "517713", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140102779", "researchers": ["Prof Fiona Haines", "Dr Sara Bice", "Prof Helen Sullivan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 132605, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:51:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:51Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140102779", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140102779", "DP140102779"], "subjects": ["POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "community participation", "regulation", "social licence"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517713"}]}]}
