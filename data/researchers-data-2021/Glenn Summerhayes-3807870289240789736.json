Rapid dispersal across the Sahul continent followed during a period of climatic deterioration. Subsequent human impacts on the landscape are well preserved in the fossil record, particularly plants. This project will implement an archaeological and palaeobotanical approach to investigate the temporal and spatial patterning of landscape use through a period of climatic change in the Late Quaternary. The results will provide a fuller understanding of the subsistence strategies and dynamics of human responses to climate change over long time periods.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150102753", "id": "618009", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102753", "researchers": ["Dr Judith Field", "Prof Glenn Summerhayes"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 485088, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:03Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102753", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102753", "DP150102753"], "subjects": ["ARCHAEOLOGY", "HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY", "ARCHAEOLOGY; NEW GUINEA; PREHISTORY"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618009"}]}]}
