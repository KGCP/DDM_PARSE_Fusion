He is currently  leading an international team investigating the co-production of free  and open source software by firms and projects as well as how this  co-production is represented in IT media (Critical Digital Infrastructure Fund,  Sloan and Ford Foundations, 2019-2020). Mathieu has played a key role  in developing the field of peer production studies by founding the Journal of Peer Production; editing four issues of this journal; and being lead editor of a Handbook of Peer Production (Wiley, 2020).Mathieu has also made significant contributions to the development of  innovative online research methods and concepts through his work with  the ANU's Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks, a world  leader in computational social science, web science, and big data  analytics. Mathieu was a member of the team which obtained ARC grant  SR0567298, a Special Research Initiative (e-Research Support) to set up  the Observatory. His subsequent research on social movements, risk issue  diffusion and the adoption of innovation in the online environment  brought together conceptual frameworks such as social network analysis  and the sociologies of fields and controversies. The quality of this  research was recognised when Mathieu and his co-author Robert Ackland  were awarded the 2012 Communication, Information Technologies, and  Media Sociology (CITAMS) section of the American Sociological  Association Paper Award. They are the sole recipients of the CITAMS  Paper Award outside North America, which recognises an \u2018outstanding  published paper or book chapter related to the sociology of  communications or the sociology of information technology\u2019.Mathieu's research has been published in two books and in peer-reviewed journals such as Social Networks, Information, Communication & Society, R\u00e9seaux, New Media and Society, and Organization Studies,  amongst others. He previously held academic appointments at the  Universit\u00e9 Stendhal - Grenoble 3, the Australian National University and  the Universit\u00e9 Paris Sorbonne. He has also worked as a magazine editor  and exhibition curator in Singapore, and as a researcher for the  Australian Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital  Economy."], "biography": "In 2008-2009 Mathieu worked as a researcher for the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy on a project to survey digital identity management practices across the Australian Public Service.
