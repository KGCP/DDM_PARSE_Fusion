It is a well-developed theory that is not only of tremendous mathematical importance, but is also widely applied to efficiently deal with allocation and scheduling problems. Much less is known, however, about the equally important but harder problem of dividing objects into collections of three or more. This project aims to address this deficiency by developing the theory of matching in important combinatorial objects. The problems it expects to solve are of great significance in their own right, and when considered together may help to lay a foundation for a more general theory of matching.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150100506", "id": "617691", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100506", "researchers": ["Prof Ian Wanless", "Prof Darryn Bryant", "Dr Daniel Horsley"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 436300, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:33Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100506", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100506", "DP150100506"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617691"}]}]}
