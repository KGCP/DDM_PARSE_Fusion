From 1998 to mid-2004, Steffen served as Executive Director of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, based in Stockholm, Sweden. His research interests span a broad range within the fields of climate and Earth System science, with an emphasis on incorporation of human processes in Earth System modelling and analysis; and on sustainability and climate change, with a focus on urban systems.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Methods and approaches to modelling the Anthropocene", "year": "2016", "source": "Global Environmental Change - Human and Policy Dimensions, vol. 39, pp. 328-340", "authors": ["Verburg P", "Dearing J", "Dyke J", "William Steffen"]}, {"title": "Network of Cooperation Between Science Organizations", "year": "2015", "source": "in W.S.
