She first obtained a bachelor of science in Physics with honours at the University of Bristol in UK in 1991. She then completed a PhD degree at the Australian National University in 1997 with her PhD thesis titled \u201cThe gettering of metals in silicon to defects induced by ion implantation\u2019. During this period, she spent 3 months as a visiting student at A.T & T. Bell Laboratories in the US working on the effect of Fe contamination on gate oxide. She was the recipient of an ARC postdoctoral fellowship (1998-2001) which was focused on implantation induced defects in silicon and also an ARC QEII fellowship (2002-2007) based on \u201cIon implantation in Silicon Carbide for microelectronics applications\u201d. Her main interests are in the structural and electrical characterisation of semiconductors. She has also been involved in defect characterisation in ion implanted semiconductors, as grown semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures. She has worked with a range of semiconductors, Si, SiC, ZnO, III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, InAs, GaP, InP, InGaAs and AlGaAs. Her expertise in semiconductors are in ion implantation defects in semiconductors with prime techniques like transmission electron microscopy, deep level transient spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. She has been involved in close collaborations with research groups in US, Sweden, Norway and the UK.", "project": ["Dopants, defects and related issues in Zinc Oxide"], "publication": [{"title": "Ultrathin Ta 2 O 5 electron-selective contacts for high efficiency InP solar cells", "year": "2019", "source": "Nanoscale, vol. 11, no. 15, pp. 7497-7505", "authors": ["Narangari P", "Karuturi S", "Wu Y", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "InGaAsP as a Promising Narrow Band Gap Semiconductor for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting", "year": "2019", "source": "ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, vol. 11, no. 28, pp. 25236-25242", "authors": ["Butson J", "Narangari P", "Lysevych M", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Multiwavelength Single Nanowire InGaAs/InP Quantum Well Light-Emitting Diodes", "year": "2019", "source": "Nano Letters, vol. 19, no. 6, pp. 3821-3829", "authors": ["Yang I", "Li Z", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Engineering III-V Semiconductor Nanowires for Device Applications", "year": "2019", "source": "Advanced Materials, vol. 32, no. 18, p. 1904359", "authors": ["Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung", "Yang I", "Li Z"]}, {"title": "The effect of nitridation on the polarity and optical properties of GaN self-assembled nanorods", "year": "2018", "source": "Nanoscale, vol. 10, no. 23, pp. 11205-11210", "authors": ["Zhao B", "Lockrey M", "Caroff-Gaonac'h P", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Perovskite Photovoltaic Integrated CdS/TiO2 Photoanode for Unbiased Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Generation", "year": "2018", "source": "ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, vol. 10, no. 28, pp. 23766-23773pp", "authors": ["Karuturi S", "Shen H", "Duong T", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "CdS/TiO2 photoanodes via solution ion transfer method for highly efficient solar hydrogen generation", "year": "2018", "source": "Nano Futures, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 8pp", "authors": ["Karuturi S", "Yew Y", "Narangari P", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Flow modulation epitaxy of hexagonal boron nitride", "year": "2018", "source": "2D Materials, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 1-10pp", "authors": ["Chugh D", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung", "Li L"]}, {"title": "Radial Growth Evolution of InGaAs/InP Multi Quantum-Well Nanowires Grown by Selective-Area Metal Organic Vapor-Phase Epitaxy", "year": "2018", "source": "ACS Nano, vol. 12, no. 10, pp. 10374-10382pp", "authors": ["Yang I", "Zhang X", "Zheng C", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Impurity Gettering by Diffusion-doped Polysilicon Passivating Contacts for Silicon Solar Cells", "year": "2018", "source": "7th IEEE World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, WCPEC 2018, IEEE, United States, pp. 1667-1671pp", "authors": ["Liu A", "Yan D", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Direct observation of the impurity gettering layers in polysilicon-based passivating contacts for silicon solar cells", "year": "2018", "source": "ACS Applied Energy Materials, vol. 1, pp. 2275-2282", "authors": ["Liu A", "Yan D", "Yin Yin Jennifer Wong Leung"]}, {"title": "Engineering III-V nanowires for optoelectronics: From epitaxy to terahertz photonics", "year": "2018", "source": "Quantum Dots and Nanostructures: Growth, Characterization, and Modeling XV 2018, ed.
