The project expects to contribute new knowledge of drought adaptation in trees, specifically identifying above and below ground interactions that may constrain evolutionary responses to climate change by assessing genotype-trait associations in an integrated, whole plant research model. Expected outcomes include enhanced capacity to design agroforestry and restoration breeding programs to increase tree productivity and resilience under increasing aridity. This will benefit the conservation of endangered Australian woodlands, restoration of degraded landscapes, and production forestry.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE190100326", "id": "1378005", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100326", "researchers": ["Dr Helen Bothwell"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 419406, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:31Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:31Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100326", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100326", "DE190100326"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378005"}]}]}
