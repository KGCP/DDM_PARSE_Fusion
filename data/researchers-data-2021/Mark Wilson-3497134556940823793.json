and loss of quality of life. Exposure to everyday physical and chemical stresses can cause proteins to lose their normal shape and become misfolded. Misfolded proteins are causally involved in human ageing and serious diseases (for example,&nbsp;Alzheimer's disease). However, the body does have a protective system that clears dangerous misfolded proteins from body fluids. Using cutting-edge approaches and a novel animal model, the project aims to establish how this system works. The outcomes are expected to improve understanding of the molecular processes affecting human ageing and disease and strengthen the framework needed to develop better strategies to combat these.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160100011", "id": "663727", "institutions": ["University of Wollongong"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100011", "researchers": ["Prof Mark Wilson", "A/Prof Heath Ecroyd"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 452800, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:33Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Wollongong"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100011", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100011", "DP160100011"], "subjects": ["BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663727"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop performance measures of individuals and groups completing collaborative problem-solving tasks.
