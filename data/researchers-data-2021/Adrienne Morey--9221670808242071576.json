"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains the most frequent cause of cancer death in the Australian population. This laboratory research will involve researchers across a number of centres in Australia. The research is focused on the effects of a new targeted cancer drug called cetuximab. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway is an important cause of NSCLC in many patients, and this is blocked by cetuximab. The advent of new targeted cancer therapies, which block specific cancer pathways in the cell, has highlighted the need for detailed knowledge about how these therapies work at the molecular level, so that we can make best use of them. The laboratory studies will be on tissues taken from patients with NSCLC who are receiving chemotherapy then going on to surgery to have the cancers removed. Tumour samples will be taken prior to treatment, and then the surgical resection will also be analysed. Sequential blood samples will also be taken. Prior to surgery, patients will receive a 9 week course of chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel to shrink the cancer. In addition, some patients will be randomised to receive cetuximab along with chemotherapy. In the laboratory, we will investigate whether various measures of activation of the EGFR pathway in the cancer and in blood predict for response to cetuximab. We will also investigate how the changes in tumour with cetuximab treatment differ from tumours not treated with the drug. We will be examining the genes and proteins of EGFR and those of a number of related pathways. a number of related receptor, along with From this we will attempt to understand which patients benefit most from the drug and also in what specific ways the cancer cells are affected by the treatment.", "title": "Biomarkers and EGFR inhibitor treatment of Lung Cancer", "id": "76658", "institutions": ["Austin Hospital Medical Research Foundation"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/415903", "researchers": ["A/Pr Paul Mitchell", "A/Pr Alexander Dobrovic", "Prof Edouard Nice", "A/Pr Adrienne Morey"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 286328.38, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:28Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Austin Hospital Medical Research Foundation"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Paul Mitchell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/415903", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/415903", "415903"], "subjects": ["ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "antibody", "anticancer drugs", "epidermal growth factor receptor", "lung cancer", "cancer therapy", "target therapy"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76658"}]}, {"description": "The Breast Cancer Biospecimen Resource will consist of stored samples of the majority of newly diagnosed breast cancers in NSW and through the Australian and New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group together with accurate, prospectively tracked clinical data on each specimen.
