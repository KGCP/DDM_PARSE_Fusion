In the past 10&nbsp;years, CT has improved our understanding in areas ranging from the evolution of life and osteoporosis to composite material failure and oil recovery. However, the full potential of CT remains unrealised because crucial features in structure and composition are overlooked by simplistic algorithms. Users cannot directly capture quantities of interest such as key compositional variation or defects, and workflows are poorly adapted for large-scale use in industrial fabrication or phenomics. This project aims to address these shortcomings using advanced mathematics and algorithms.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP150101040", "id": "626001", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150101040", "researchers": ["Dr Andrew Kingston", "Dr Glenn Myers", "A/Prof Adrian Sheppard", "Prof Timothy Senden"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 559000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150101040", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150101040", "LP150101040"], "subjects": ["CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/626001"}]}]}
