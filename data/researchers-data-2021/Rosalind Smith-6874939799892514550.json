I have a particular interest in the forms in which women made such interventions, and am a leading international expert on the sonnet, the sonnet sequence, marginal annotation and complaint, as well as on the reception of early modern women\u2019s writing from the sixteenth century to the present. This work is at the forefront of what is known as the\u00a0material turn\u00a0in early modern studies, scholarship that attends to the material forms in which early modern writing was produced, circulated, transmitted over time, and read. My\u00a0research projects always combine formal, material and theoretical approaches with digital methods, exploring how digital forms can make us view the past in new ways. I am interested in the intersection of digital humanities with traditional literary scholarhip, and my current research includes scholarship on digital editing, archival longevity, and new
