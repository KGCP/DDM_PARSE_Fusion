As well as forecasting how new technologies can be exploited by criminals, Professor Manning studies which policing strategies really work. As a future crimes scholar he is committed to advancing knowledge about: (1) why individuals commit future crimes; (2) the processes that can be adopted to make committing future crimes more difficult and less rewarding; and (3) the tools that assist government and industry in making strategic economic decisions that create efficiency and enhance return on investment. His work in this area has contributed to the development of theories for identifying where and how individuals commit these forms of crime, processes that minimise insider threat, and tools that provide economic evidence that assist in policy decision making.", "project": ["Current projects", "Imputing missing values using AI - Collaboration with the Research School of Computer Science ANU and the Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science.", "Economic Support and Reporting APP (ESRT) - ESRT is being developed to assist members of community coalitions (including government) to develop economic evidence around programs and interventions that support children and families.", "Smart Cost-Benefit Tools - Collaboration with the Research School of Computer Science ANU and the Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, University College London.", "Metropolitan Police Ring Doorbell Evaluation (Metropolitan Police UK).
