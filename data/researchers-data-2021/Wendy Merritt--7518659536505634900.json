The SIAGI project is taking an interdisciplinary approach utilising social, institutional and biophysical research methods and spanning community to policy scales. The main research areas of the project are: social justice and livelihoods, markets for the poor and value chains, risk assessment, integrated modelling, NGO good practice and policy support.\u00a0 Together with Dr Serena Hamilton from the Edith Cowan University, the ANU team are contributing to the development of integrated models to inform the design of agricultural intensification options that better support marginalised or vulnerable households. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has commissioned CSIRO to lead the project. Further details on the SIAGI project can be accessed from https://siagi.org/.", "", "Murray Darling Basin Authority: Strategic Research Program", "As part of a research partnership between the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) and the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training (NCGRT), researchers from the Fenner School, ANU, and Charles Sturt University are developing an integrated assessment framework to assist the MDBA in improving its understanding of the relationships between key external drivers (e.g. water policy, crop markets, climate variability) and Basin Plan objectives. The project is identifying surface water and groundwater complementary use opportunities available to the irrigation districts in the Campaspe River and Murrumbidgee River case studies and assessing their technical feasibility, adoptability, social acceptability and environmental impact. The current and intended on-farm water use efficiency (WUE) measures of irrigators is also being examined. An integrated model is being developed which will be used to identify the extent to which combinations of options (complementary uses and/or WUE measures) enable irrigators to meet existing policy requirements, and any environmental and farm viability trade-offs, under plausible scenarios of (e.g.) near-future climate.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "What do we need from catchment water quality models in Australia?", "year": "2019", "source": "23rd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM2019), ed.
