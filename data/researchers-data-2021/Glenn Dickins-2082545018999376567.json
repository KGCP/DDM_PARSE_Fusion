With more consumers choosing PSAPs, proper testing is needed to assess the devices&rsquo; safety and benefit in real-life acoustic situations. This project will test PSAPs in laboratory setups that use spatial audio processing techniques to mimic realistic acoustic environments, and develop theoretical frameworks to overcome existing limitations to accurate spatial sound reproduction. This research is expected to provide innovative solutions to safeguard Australia's future hearing health.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP160100379", "id": "941812", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100379", "researchers": ["Prof Thushara Abhayapala", "Adj/Prof Glenn Dickins", "Dr Wen Zhang"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 318000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:55Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:53Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100379", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100379", "LP160100379"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/941812"}]}]}
