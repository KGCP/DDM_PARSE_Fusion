This community is currently widely dispersed with scholars  coming from many different disciplinary backgrounds. An Academic  Workshop will target academics who have or are about to undertake  empirical research related to GIs and their impact. By including  policy-makers in the assessment and evaluation of existing knowledge it  will enhance the ability of academics to focus their work to maximise  its relevance to policy-makers. The GI Project will support  dissemination of knowledge about the impact of GIs among policymakers  not usually exposed to the empirical evidence on the impact of GIs. The  Project will create an impetus within the academic community to fill in  the key knowledge gaps needed to improve the effectiveness of GI policy.", "For further information see:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://bit.ly/2zHuhuo"], "publication": [{"title": "Financial costs associated with monopolies on biologic medicines in Australia", "year": "2019", "source": "Australian Health Review, vol. 43, pp. 36-42pp", "authors": ["Gleeson D", "Townsend B", "Lopert R", "Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "The market size for GI food products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c evidence from the empirical economic literature", "year": "2018", "source": "Studies in Agricultural Economics, vol. 120, pp. 134-142", "authors": ["Aron T", "Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Understanding EU trade policy on geographical indications", "year": "2017", "source": "Journal of World Trade, vol. 51, no. 6, pp. 1021-1042pp", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Issues and evidence on copyright, trademarks and geographical indications: Response to the Productivity Commission", "year": "2016", "source": "s Issues Paper on Intellectual Property Arrangements", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "The impact of patent and data protection policy on access to affordable medicines: Submission to the United Nations Secretary-General", "year": "2016", "source": "s High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement and access to HIV treatment in Vietnam", "year": "2016", "source": "Global Public Health: An International Journal for Research Policy and Practice, pp. 1-14", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir", "Tenni B", "Gleeson D"]}, {"title": "Exploring evergreening: insights from two medicines", "year": "2016", "source": "The Australian Economic Review, vol. 49, no. 4, pp. 413-431", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Reviewing patent policy: an exercise in futility?", "year": "2015", "source": "Prometheus, vol. 33, no. 4, pp. 431-443", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Copyright in the digital environment", "year": "2012", "source": "submission to the ALRC inquiry into Copyright and the Digital Economy.", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2011", "source": "Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Empirical evidence on patents and data protection: Response to the Productivity Commission", "year": "2016", "source": "s Issues Paper on Intellectual Property Arrangements", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "COSTS TO AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL MONOPOLIES AND PROPOSALS TO EXTEND THEM IN THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT", "year": "2015", "source": "Medical Journal of Australia, vol. 202, no. 6, pp. 306-U130", "authors": ["Gleeson D", "Hazel V J Moir", "Lopert R"]}, {"title": "The patent price of market access in the AUSFTA", "year": "2015", "source": "Australian Journal of International Affairs, vol. 69, no. 5, pp. 559-576", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Geographic Indications: heritage or terroir?", "year": "2015", "source": "10th Annual Conference of the EPIP Association, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, pp. 1-26, available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=265613", "authors": ["Hazel V J Moir"]}, {"title": "Competition Policy Review: Draft Report", "year": "2014", "source": "September 2014.
