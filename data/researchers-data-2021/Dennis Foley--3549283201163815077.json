In the last decade, Aboriginal-owned small business has increased; Indigenous Chambers of Commerce have been established and have developed memorandums of understanding for procurement of goods and services with industry; and the Opportunity, Choice, Healing, Responsibility, Empowerment (OCHRE) project was implemented by the NSW Department of Aboriginal Affairs to stimulate economic development within Australia&rsquo;s largest Aboriginal population. Using NSW as a case study, the project intends to assess economic development, job creation, new company creation, increase in the wellbeing of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal partners, and increase in social positivity.
