that overcome key challenges in today's concentrating solar thermal systems. The development of accurate micro/nanofabrication and characterisation techniques in recent years has made it possible to achieve thermofluid devices that are engineered from the bottom up to achieve high performance at relatively low cost. This project aims to develop a new class of solar thermal receivers which use micro/nanotechnology to directly absorb concentrated solar energy with very little pumping power and minimal radiative heat loss. By tailoring the geometry and materials inside the receiver, the project expects to achieve a unique level of integrated optical, heat transfer and fluid flow control.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE160100131", "id": "663550", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100131", "researchers": ["Dr Robert Taylor"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 300000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:31Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100131", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100131", "DE160100131"], "subjects": ["INTERDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663550"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop a new membrane distillation module that works with a high efficiency solar thermal tower system.
