expectations of mutual support and the lack of detailed security commitments in the Australia-US Alliance. The project intends to use a focused approach that captures thematic aspects of the alliance through project frames and historical slices across time. Expected outcomes can advance understanding of how alliances operate as security institutions. The outcomes can help to promote a more informed national conversation about the costs and benefits of Australia's security relationship with the United States of America (USA) and contribute to debates over the future of the Australia-USA Alliance during a period of strategic uncertainty.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100881", "id": "1378300", "institutions": ["Griffith University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100881", "researchers": ["Prof Andrew O'Neil", "A/Prof Stephan Fr\u00fchling", "Prof Peter Dean"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 227033, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Griffith University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100881", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100881", "DP190100881"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378300"}]}]}
