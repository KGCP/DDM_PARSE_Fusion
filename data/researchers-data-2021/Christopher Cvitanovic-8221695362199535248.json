Second, this research seeks to improve the ways in which knowledge exchange processes are evaluated (Posner and Cvitanovic, 2019) so as to improve our capacity to learn from existing efforts, and provide guiding principles for future initiatives aimed at linking marine science to policy and practice (e.g. Fig 1 in Cvitanovic and Hobday 2018). A key focus throughout all of this research has been identifying the institutional changes that are needed (by research organisations, government agencies and research funders) to better support a more dynamic relationship between marine science, policy and practice. \u00a0Theme 3: Public engagement for ocean literacyThe third theme of Chris\u2019 research is focused on improving ocean literary among the public (e.g. community groups, tourists, etc.) for better environmental outcomes.\u00a0 This research stream developed following several years of collaborating with marine park managers in Australia across Commonwealth and State levels, and learning about their need for engagement strategies that can reach all segments of diverse communities and user groups.\u00a0 Thus, to ensure the practical utility of this research it is co-developed with different marine park managers.\u00a0 Recent examples include a study from the Ningaloo Coast in Australia that sought to understand community perceptions about the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park, so as to develop a typology of \u2018community members\u2019, and identify specific engagement strategies to engage with each \u2018type\u2019 of community member (Cvitanovic et al. 2018b). \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Building the capacity of early career marine scientistsIn addition to his research, Chris\u2019 work also focuses on helping to build the capacity of early career marine scientists in relation to the themes outlined above.\u00a0 For example, Chris has co-authored several articles focused on helping early career researchers understand how to achieve impacts on policy and practice (e.g. Evans and Cvitanovic, 2018), and how to engage more effectively as part of interdisciplinary research teams and processes (e.g. Kelly et al. 2019; Moon et al. under review).\u00a0 He is also a regular lecturer for the IMBeR ClimEco International Summer School series, and has convened practical workshops in Australia and overseas for early career scientists focused on building capacity for policy engagement."], "biography": "Chris was the founding chair of The Interdisciplinary Marine Early Career Network where he continues to serve as a member of the Organising Committee.\u00a0 He is also on the Editorial Boards for the Springer-Nature journals Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries and Socio-Ecological Practice Research.\u00a0 Previously Chris has also served as a member of the Integrated Marine Biosphere Research (IMBeR) project Scientific Steering Committee and the MarXiv Advisory Board.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "pplying an Organizational Psychology Model for Developing Shared Goals in Interdisciplinary Research Teams", "year": "2020", "source": "One Earth, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 75-83", "authors": ["Christopher Cvitanovic", "Colvin R", "Reynolds K"]}, {"title": "To Achieve a Sustainable Blue Future, Progress Assessments Must Include Interdependencies between the Sustainable Development Goals", "year": "2020", "source": "One Earth, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 161-173", "authors": ["Nash K", "Blythe J", "Christopher Cvitanovic"]}, {"title": "Principles for knowledge co-production in sustainability research", "year": "2020", "source": "Nature Sustainability, vol. 3, pp. 182-190", "authors": ["Norstrom A", "Christopher Cvitanovic", "Lof M"]}, {"title": "Engaging More Effectively With Visitors to Coastal Regions for Improved Management Outcomes: Insights From the Ningaloo Coast, Australia", "year": "2020", "source": "Frontiers in Marine Science, vol. 7, no. 583, pp. 1-14", "authors": ["Christopher Cvitanovic", "van Putten I", "Kelly R"]}, {"title": "Coupling property rights with responsibilities to improve conservation outcomes across land and seascapes [IN PRESS]", "year": "2020", "source": "Conservation Letters, vol.
