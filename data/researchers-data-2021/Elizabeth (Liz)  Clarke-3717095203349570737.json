This includes exploring problem, context and scale; and designing, implementing and evaluating action research. Her experience is broadly based, encompassing research, international development, policy, governance, community development, and business and communication. Through her research experience (particularly facilitating and coordinating collaboration and coproduction) she provides important insights into research and academic cultures and the constraints and challenges researchers face in engaging in complex problems in partnership with practitioners, policy-makers, and communities, and in dealing with the complexities and contradictions and conflicts that this generates.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and practice: Balancing expectations of the", "year": "2020", "source": "old' academy with the future model of universities as problem solvers''Higher Education Quarterly, vol. 74, pp. 19-34", "authors": ["Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke"]}, {"title": "Balance Brings Beauty", "year": "2019", "source": "PENSOFT PUBLISHERSNA", "authors": ["Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke"]}, {"title": "Insights into adoption of farming practices through multiple lenses: an innovation systems approach", "year": "2018", "source": "Development in Practice, vol. 28, no. 8, pp. 983-998pp", "authors": ["Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke"]}, {"title": "Making Collective Learning Coherent: An Adaptive Approach to the Practice of Transdisciplinary Pedagogy", "year": "2018", "source": "in Dena Fam, Linda Neuhauser and Paul Gibbs (ed.), Transdisciplinary Theory, Practice and Education, Springer, Cham, pp. 151-165pp", "authors": ["Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke"]}, {"title": "Integrated Nutrient\u00e2\u20ac\u201cWeed Management Under Mechanised Dry Direct Seeding (Dds) Is Essential For Sustained Smallholder Adoption In Rainfed Lowland Rice (Oryza Sativa L.)", "year": "2018", "source": "Experimental Agriculture, vol. 55, no. 4, pp. 509-525", "authors": ["Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke", "Elizabeth (Liz)  Clarke"]}, {"title": "Transdisciplinary project communication and Knowledge sharing experiences in Tanzania and Zambia through a One Health lens", "year": "2016", "source": "Frontiers in Public Health, vol. 4, no.
