I was a Senior Research Associate at the State Research Institute of Aviation  Systems in 1993\u20131997 and the Institute for Information Transmission  Problems, the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, in 1994\u20132007, working in the  areas of applied Kalman filtering,\u00a0 stochastic robust control,  hysteresis systems\u00a0 and spatial discretizations of dynamical systems.  From 1997 to 2008, I held research academic positions of  Research Officer, Research Fellow and Senior Research Fellow at the  Mathematics Department and School of Engineering at the University of  Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, working under support of the Australian  Research Council in the above areas and also in stochastic  modelling of econometric time series, lattice models of statistical  mechanics and transport phenomena in random media. In 2000, I was a visiting research fellow at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, working on p-adic analysis of Hamiltonian roundoff. From 2009 to 2016, I was a  Senior Research Fellow at UNSW Canberra, doing research in the areas of quantum and stochastic  control. In 2013, I was awarded B.N.Petrov  prize of the Russian Academy of Sciences for my works on the  anisotropy-based theory of stochastic robust filtering and control.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Dissipative linear stochastic Hamiltonian systems", "year": "2019", "source": "2018 Australian and New Zealand Control Conference, ANZCC 2018, IEEE, Piscataway, United States, pp. 227-232", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I"]}, {"title": "Multi-point Gaussian states, quadratic-exponential cost functionals, and large deviations estimates for linear quantum stochastic systems", "year": "2018", "source": "Applied Mathematics and Optimization, vol. 83, 2021, pp. 83\u2013137", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I", "James M"]}, {"title": "phase-space formulation and Gaussian approximation of the filtering equations for nonlinear quantum stochastic systems", "year": "2017", "source": "Control Theory and Technology, vol. 15, no. 3, pp. 177-192", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov"]}, {"title": "Directly coupled observers for quantum harmonic oscillators with discounted mean square cost functionals and penalized back-action", "year": "2016", "source": "2016 IEEE Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century, 21CW 2016, IEEE, pp. 78-83", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I"]}, {"title": "Phase-space formulation of the Belavkin-Kushner-Stratonovich filtering equation for nonlinear quantum stochastic systems", "year": "2016", "source": "IEEE Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century (21CW), IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, pp. 84-89", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov"]}, {"title": "State distributions and minimum relative entropy noise sequences in uncertain stochastic systems: the discrete-time case", "year": "2015", "source": "SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, vol. 53, no. 3, pp. 1107-1153", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I"]}, {"title": "stochastic density matrix approach to approximation of probability distributions and its application to nonlinear systems", "year": "2015", "source": "IEEE Conference on Control and Applications, CCA 2015, IEEE, pp. 1090-1095", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov"]}, {"title": "transverse Hamiltonian variational technique for open quantum stochastic systems and its application to coherent quantum control", "year": "2015", "source": "IEEE Conference on Control and Applications, CCA 2015, IEEE, pp. 29  -34", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov"]}, {"title": "Weyl variations and local sufficiency of linear observers in the mean square optimal coherent quantum filtering problem", "year": "2015", "source": "Australian Control Conference (AUCC 2015), Engineers Australia, Australia, pp. 93-98", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov"]}, {"title": "Physical realizability and mean square performance of translation invariant networks of interacting linear quantum stochastic systems", "year": "2014", "source": "21st International Symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems, MTNS, The Netherlands, pp. 1881-1888", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I"]}, {"title": "quantum mechanical version of Price", "year": "2014", "source": "s theorem for Gaussian states'4th Australian Control Conference, AUCC 2014, Engineers Australia, pp. 118-123", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov"]}, {"title": "quasi-separation principle and Newton-like scheme for coherent quantum LQG control", "year": "2013", "source": "Systems and Control Letters, vol. 62, no. 7, pp. 550-559", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I"]}, {"title": "Coherent quantum filtering for physically realizable linear quantum plants", "year": "2013", "source": "European Control Conference, ECC 2013, IEEE, Zurich, pp. 2717-2723", "authors": ["Igor Vladimirov", "Petersen I"]}, {"title": "The monomer-dimer problem and moment Lyapunov exponents of homogeneous Gaussian random fields", "year": "2013", "source": "Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems -
