I am interested in cryptographic protocols that support a free and  democratic society. I work on openly-available research and open source software for  supporting democratic decisionmaking and empowering ordinary people to  make choices about their own data.Some highlights and favourite papers are:Cryptographic analysis of e-voting systemsWe've shown serious errors and security problems in e-voting and e-counting systems in Western Australia, New South Wales and Switzerland.   The problems we identified allowed for undetectable privacy breach or  election manipulation. We hope that we have made that a little harder.   Our talk for IEEE Security and Privacy (Oakland) is here.  The same attack applies also to the NSW iVote system, with a slight modification described here.See also this nontechnical article from the IEEE Security and Privacy magazine, which explains the main ideas of electronic election verification.Joint work with Andrew Conway, Chris Culnane, Mark Eldridge, Aleks Essex, Alex Halderman, Thomas Haines, Sarah Jamie Lewis and Olivier Pereira.Auditing complex electionsWe've developed a number of new tools and techniques, most supported  by open source software, for auditing complex elections.  This  culminated in a world-first pilot Risk-Limiting Audit of Instant Runoff Votes in San Francisco in November 2019.  You can do RLA's for IRV!See also our proposal for auditing Parliamentary elections such as India's.Joint work with Andrew Conway, Michelle Blom, Chris Culnane, Dan King, Laurent Sandrolini, Philip B. Stark and Peter J. Stuckey.Privacy and open dataChris Culnane, Ben Rubinstein and I demonstrated the easy re-identifiability of doctors and patients in open Australian Medicare-PBS data and of ordinary commuters in open Victorian Public Transport data.   We were hoping this would encourage the enlightened view that a  person's detailed personal data is still theirs, even when their name  has been removed.\u00a0\u00a0Exposure Notification and contact tracingSee\u00a0https://github.com/vteague/contactTracing\u00a0repo for analysis of COVIDSafe and other exposure notification options.\u00a0You can also follow me on Twitter @VTeagueAus or see https://www.thinkingcybersecurity.com"], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "rational secret sharing and multiparty computation extended abstract", "year": 2006, "source": "arxiv computer science and game theory", "authors": [{"name": "joseph y halpern", "affiliation": "cornell university"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "stanford university"}], "id": 2595104227}, {"title": "rational secret sharing and multiparty computation extended abstract", "year": 2004, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "joseph y halpern", "affiliation": "cornell university"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "stanford university"}]}, {"title": "a unified evaluation of two candidate ballot polling election auditing methods", "year": 2020, "source": "arxiv applications", "authors": [{"name": "zhuoqun huang", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "ronald l rivest", "affiliation": "massachusetts institute of technology"}, {"name": "philip b stark", "affiliation": "university of california berkeley"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "damjan vukcevic", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}], "id": 2596726383}, {"title": "a unified evaluation of two candidate ballot polling election auditing methods", "year": 2020, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "zhuoqun huang", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "ronald l rivest", "affiliation": "massachusetts institute of technology"}, {"name": "philip b stark", "affiliation": "university of california berkeley"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "australian national university"}, {"name": "damjan vukcevic", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}]}, {"title": "public evidence from secret ballots", "year": 2017, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "matthew bernhard", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "josh benaloh", "affiliation": "microsoft"}, {"name": "j alex halderman", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "ronald l rivest", "affiliation": "massachusetts institute of technology"}, {"name": "peter y a ryan", "affiliation": "university of luxembourg"}, {"name": "philip b stark", "affiliation": "university of california berkeley"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "poorvi l vora", "affiliation": "george washington university"}, {"name": "dan s wallach", "affiliation": "rice university"}]}, {"title": "public evidence from secret ballots", "year": 2017, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "matthew bernhard", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "josh benaloh", "affiliation": "microsoft"}, {"name": "j alex halderman", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "ronald l rivest", "affiliation": "massachusetts institute of technology"}, {"name": "peter y a ryan", "affiliation": "university of luxembourg"}, {"name": "philip b stark", "affiliation": "university of california berkeley"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "poorvi l vora", "affiliation": "george washington university"}, {"name": "dan s wallach", "affiliation": "rice university"}]}, {"title": "the new south wales ivote system security failures and verification flaws in a live online election", "year": 2015, "source": "arxiv cryptography and security", "authors": [{"name": "j alex halderman", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}], "id": 2595770078}, {"title": "the new south wales ivote system security failures and verification flaws in a live online election", "year": 2015, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "j alex halderman", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}]}, {"title": "rational secret sharing and multiparty computation", "year": 2004, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "joseph y halpern"}, {"name": "vanessa teague"}]}, {"title": "vvote a verifiable voting system", "year": 2015, "source": "acm transactions on information and system security", "authors": [{"name": "chris culnane", "affiliation": "university of surrey"}, {"name": "peter y a ryan", "affiliation": "university of luxembourg"}, {"name": "steve schneider", "affiliation": "university of surrey"}, {"name": "vanessa teague", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}], "id": 2642811}], "ANDS-Grants": [{"description": "More information for better utility; less information for better privacy. The contradiction is everywhere in contemporary IT: doctors need accurate information for diagnosis, but insurance companies' access should be limited; on-line retailers use your postcode to present interesting products, but they also deduce from it how much you will pay. One way to manage this contradiction is to tolerate &quot;small&quot; information flows providing the risks involved can be accurately gauged. This project will build on recent advances in information measuring to develop new techniques for measuring the extent to which computer systems can defend against threats to privacy.
