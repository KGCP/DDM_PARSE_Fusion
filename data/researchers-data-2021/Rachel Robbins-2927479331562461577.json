I then went on to teach at U Canberra for most of a year before taking a post-doc at McMaster University in Canada working with Prof Daphene Maurer and Prof Terri Lewis on the effects of early visual deprivation on face and object recognition. I then completed a second post-doc with Prof Max Coltheart at Macquarie University on face and body recognition. I took up a Research Lectureship at Western Sydney University in 2010, where I remained until family committments brought me back to Canberra in 2015.
