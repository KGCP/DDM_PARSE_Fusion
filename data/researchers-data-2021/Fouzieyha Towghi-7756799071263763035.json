Linking theories from anthropology, feminist techno-science studies and postcolonial feminist theories and methods, I have analysed the entanglements of biomedical and global health development policies to trace the corporeal and social effects of trans-historical and transnational mobilities of bio-scientific ideas, biotechnologies, and human rights policies and experts. I have explicated the impacts of these processes particularly on poor and rural women\u2019s bodies and social material/environmental conditions in South Asian contexts.I have published on the relationship between the HPV vaccine, local biologies, and the \u00a0epigenetics of cervical cancer; cultural politics of reproductive health; debates on the role of indigenous midwives and traditional medicines in women\u2019s care; impact of health development policies on local midwifery and women\u2019s access to care consequent to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals outlined for the reduction of global maternal mortality rates; and the risks for poor and rural women of advocating off-label low-tech pharmaceuticals in homebirths in Pakistan. My work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals,\u00a0Medical Anthropology\u00a0and\u00a0Ethnos\u00a0as well as in the books,\u00a0Negotiating Normativity\u00a0(2016),\u00a0Critical Mobilties\u00a0(2013); and\u00a0Unhealthy Policy\u00a0(2004). In 2015, my article, \u201cNormalizing Off-Label Experiments and the Pharmaceuticalization of Homebirths in Pakistan,\u201d was awarded the Rudolph Virchow Professional Award, by the Critical Anthropology for Global Health Caucus of the Society for Medical Anthropology.I am currently writing my first book, provisionally titled,\u00a0Caring \u2018In the Times of the Ladies\u2019: Contesting Humanitarian Imaginaries of Women\u2019s Health, Midwives, and the Tribal in Rural Balochistan.\u00a0The ethnography draws on over six years of work and fifteen months of sustained ethnographic research in Balochistan, Pakistan to trace the biopolitics of global reproductive health and rights policies and pharmaceutical globalization and the impact of these processes on Baloch women and their culture of midwifery."], "biography": "", "project": ["As a postdoctoral research fellow with the Swiss Network for Mobilities Studies in the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Z\u00fcrich (2009-2012), I developed my ideas for my second book tentatively titled,\u00a0Biopolitics of Reproductive Technologies Beyond the Clinic: Remaking Adolescents in the Era of Molecular Biology.\u00a0For this project, I initiated a new ethnographic research project in India, Switzerland,and the United States to investigate the effects of the globalization of HPV vaccine on Indian women\u2019s health, cervical cancer prevention efforts, and India\u2019s public health care system. Phase one of the project investigated the links between the innovations in the molecular biology of cervical cancer and the rise of the HPV-vaccine and how this is reconfiguring global reproductive health policies and public health care practices in India. My fieldwork in several Indian cities and rural areas in 2009, 2011, and 2012 traced the simultaneous emergence of the HPV vaccine and global health cervical cancer prevention programs, in the context of the shifting nexus between biomedicine, biotechnologies, the state, and population health care there. I examined some of the public health and scientific claims as well as the policy and institutional arrangements crafted to facilitate the flow of the vaccine and localize its distribution in rural and urban Indian locales through the public health system. (For preliminary findings see: Towghi 2013; Towghi and Randeria 2013). I am currently developing Phase II of this research that aims to study how the introduction of the HPV vaccine and HPV screening technologies in clinical settings is mediating pre-existing cervical cancer prevention and therapeutic practices and the hospital preventive services that are inceasinlgy linked to public health community outreach efforts in India.", "I joined ANU with 10 years of prior teaching experience in Anthropology and Gender & Women's Studies.
