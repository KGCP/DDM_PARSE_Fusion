Indigenous welfare recipients living in remote Australia are subject to regulatory frameworks that make social security payments contingent on meeting conditions, with significant penalties for non-compliance with program requirements. The goal is to examine the regulation and governance that underpin these three programs. The intended outcome is to identify social security principles and policies that are likely to work best in improving the welfare of Indigenous peoples while benefiting the delivery of social security in Australia and beyond.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE180100599", "id": "1315150", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100599", "researchers": ["Dr Shelley Bielefeld"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 363487, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:28Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:09Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100599", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100599", "DE180100599"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1315150"}]}, {"description": "Using an innovative methodology that incorporates a cross-national comparison of policy design and practice, this project aims to explore the effects of income management policies.
