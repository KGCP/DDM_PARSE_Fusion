When biologists make statements about history, they use evolutionary trees, frequently reconstructed from the genetic data of many individuals. Next-generation sequencing provides large amounts of genetic data at low cost, but biologists have difficulty using these data for evolutionary research, particularly when they sample mixtures of DNA from many individuals. The anticipated value of this project is that it allows evolutionary biologists to capitalise on the benefits of next-generation sequencing, without sacrificing their ability to make reliable inferences about history.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160103474", "id": "664187", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103474", "researchers": ["Prof Allen Rodrigo"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 491900, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103474", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103474", "DP160103474"], "subjects": ["GENETICS", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664187"}]}]}
