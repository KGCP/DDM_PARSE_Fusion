annually, resulting in 1.1 million deaths. The majority of cases occur in developing countries and most deaths occur in children under 5 years of age. Shigellosis is mainly caused by the bacterium Shigella flexneri. There are 13 different serotypes of S. flexneri determined by bacterial cell-surface polysaccharides called O-antigens. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) carry the genes which confer O-antigen variation. Infection and subsequent incorporation of the virus into the genetic material of the bacterial cell result in modification of the bacterial O-antigen. This phage-mediated O-antigen modification gives rise to different serotypes. The project will address fundamental processes related to the O-antigen modification. This will be achieved by studying structure and function of the enzymes encoded by the O-antigen modification gene cluster.
