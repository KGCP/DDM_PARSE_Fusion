New tools from genomics, phylogenetics and spatial environmental analysis are revolutionizing our ability to discover diversity and map hotspots of unique species- or phylo-diversity. Building on previous studies of rainforests in eastern Australia and Brazil, and in California, our lab is now turning its attention to the monsoonal tropics of Australia \u2013 perhaps the largest ecologically intact tropical savanna on the planet, and also a frontier for biodiversity discovery.Biogeography and speciationHow new species form through a combination of selection, drift and isolation is intimately connected with the dynamics of the habitats they occupy in time and space. Our lab seeks to understand this dynamic at multiple scales, from populations and phylogographic lineages to entire clades, often using a comparative approach in particular biogeographic regions (eg. The Australian Wet Tropics Rainforests), and all in the context of current and paleo-environments. As a continental-scale island with a largely endemic biota, Australia provides an excellent opportunity for such studies.Biological responses to climate changeThough existing species have persisted through multiple episodes of climate change in the past, we are entering a new phase of rapid, human-caused climate change with no analogue in the recent geological past. Understanding how species respond by migration or adaptation is key to finding strategies to promote persistence of biodiversity. Our lab studies this through a combination of comparative studies of phenotypic and genomic diversity in across environments in space and time. One potential solution is to identify long-term climatic refugia across the landscape - also likely centers of local diversity \u2013 and seek to protect these and habitat linkages to them. We also are using a combination of population genomics and data on trait and environments to test whether peripheral isolates of rainforest lizards are better adapted to climate fluctuation than populations in core rainforests."], "biography": "Craig did his undergraduate at University of Melbourne (1976-1979), where he developed his passion for evolutionary biology. For his PhD at ANU (1980-1985), he studied chromosome evolution and speciation in arid zone lizards, along the way discovering all-female reproduction in\u00a0Heteronotia binoei. Then he moved across the Pacific Ocean for a postdoc at University of Michigan (1985-1988; mitochondrial DNA and evolution of parthenogenesis), before returning to a faculty position at The University of Queensland (1988-2000), including a stint as Head of School. From 2000-2012 he was Director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley. From mid 2012 he happily settled at EEG/RSB as a Professor and\u00a0ARC Laureate Fellow. Craig is also the Director of the joint ANU-CSIRO\u00a0Centre for Biodiversity Analysis.", "project": [""], "publication": [{"title": "Real-world conservation planning for evolutionary diversity in the Kimberley, Australia, sidesteps uncertain taxonomy", "year": "2018", "source": "Conservation Letters, vol. 11, no. 4, pp. e12438", "authors": ["Rosauer D", "Byrne M", "Blom M", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Cryptic lineage diversity, body size divergence, and sympatry in a species complex of Australian lizards (Gehyra)", "year": "2018", "source": "Evolution, vol. 72, no. 1, pp. 54-66", "authors": ["Craig Moritz", "Pratt R", "Bank S"]}, {"title": "Pleistocene climatic changes drive diversification across a tropical savanna", "year": "2018", "source": "Molecular Ecology, vol. 27, no. 2, pp. 520-532", "authors": ["Potter S", "Xue A", "Bragg J", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Phylogenomics of a rapid radiation: The Australian rainbow skinks", "year": "2018", "source": "BMC Evolutionary Biology, vol. 18, no. 15, pp. 12pp", "authors": ["Bragg J", "Potter S", "Silva A", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Biome stability in South America over the last 30 kyr: Inferences from long-term vegetation dynamics and habitat modelling", "year": "2018", "source": "Global Ecology and Biogeography, vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 285-297pp", "authors": ["Costa G", "Hampe A", "Ledru M", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "nalysis of phylogenomic tree space resolves relationships among marsupial families", "year": "2018", "source": "Systematic Biology, vol. 67, no. 3, pp. 400-412pp", "authors": ["Duchene D", "Bragg J", "Duchene S", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "djusting to climate: Acclimation, adaptation and developmental plasticity in physiological traits of a tropical rainforest lizard", "year": "2018", "source": "Integrative Zoology Online, vol. 13, no. 4, pp. 411-427", "authors": ["Llewelyn J", "Macdonald S", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Resources for phylogenomic analyses of Australian terrestrial vertebrates", "year": "2017", "source": "Molecular Ecology Resources, vol. 17, pp. 869-876pp", "authors": ["Bragg J", "Potter S", "Bi K", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Erosion of refugia in the Sierra Nevada meadows\r\nnetwork with climate change", "year": "2017", "source": "Ecosphere, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 1-17pp", "authors": ["Maher S", "Morelli T", "Hershey M", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Divergence of thermal physiological traits in terrestrial breeding frogs along a tropical elevational gradient", "year": "2017", "source": "Ecology and Evolution, vol. 7, no. 9, pp. 3257-3267", "authors": ["von May R", "Catenazzi A", "Corl A", "Craig Moritz"]}, {"title": "Characterizing divergence through three adjacent Australian avian transition zones", "year": "2017", "source": "Journal of Biogeography, vol.
