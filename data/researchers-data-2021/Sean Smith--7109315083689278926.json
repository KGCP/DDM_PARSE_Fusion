This leads to new fundamental scientific discoveries as well as new materials and biomaterials applications and technologies, with associated commercialization activities.\u00a0Specific project areas are summarized below:\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electrocatalyst materials design for sustainable energy applications.High performance materials simulations are carried out at an atomistic level to develop new electrocatalyst materials and new electrocatalysis technologies, needed for sustainable energy targets such as water splitting and catalytic CO2 transformation.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nanoparticle/Dendrimer/Polymeric Vector Complexation with DNA, siRNA, proteins and small organic drugs for cellular delivery applications. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore structure and stability of drug/vector complexes in aqueous solution. This work contributes towards a knowledge-based approach to optimizing the efficiency of drug delivery to cells for biomedical and biotechnology applications.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nanomaterials design and adsorption technologies for Hydrogen Storage. We use using solid state electronic structure calculations and structure/kinetics models to elucidate catalytic mechanisms of hydrogen ad/absorption and desorption in designed nanocomposite materials. In addition to the fundamental importance and interest of metal-hydrogen interactions, this work aims towards the development of a hydrogen storage system that can be used for mobile transport applications.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic and Photovoltaic Applications. We are modelling electronic structure and surface interactions of metal oxide nanoparticles of great interest for photocatalysis (solar to hydrogen conversion) and photovoltaic applications.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Novel membrane materials for CO2 gas capture and separation. In collaboration with experimental colleagues, we are exploring the design of new membranes for selective separation of carbon dioxide. Quantum chemical calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics are used to explore the interactions of small gaseous species such as CO2, N2, H2O, CH4 and H2 with different 2-d membrane or polymeric architectures in order to assess the degree of selectivity for CO2 that can be achieved."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "injuries and
