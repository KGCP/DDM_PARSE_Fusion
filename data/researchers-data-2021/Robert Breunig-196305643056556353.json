entry and exit. Although the SME sector is Australia&rsquo;s largest employer, the extent to which financial constraints affect these firms' market performance and their ability to create and sustain employment is unknown. The project plans to use an econometric analysis of firm level panel data to fill this gap. The intended outcome is micro-econometric findings tailored to improve targeted labour and financial policy. The expected benefit is to provide input to policy responses that support employment, productivity and wages in volatile market conditions.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160101914", "id": "663987", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101914", "researchers": ["A/Prof Elisabetta Magnani", "Prof Robert Breunig", "Dr David Prentice", "Dr Sasan Bakhtiari"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 239000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101914", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101914", "DP160101914"], "subjects": ["APPLIED ECONOMICS", "ECONOMICS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663987"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to improve compliance and payment in the Australian tax system.
