His initial training was in electrical engineering and he worked for a few years as a software engineer. However, he had developed insatiable curiosity for economics and economic development and therefore he made a career switch and retrained himself in economics and econometrics. His publication record shows his versatility and ability to undertake research in a range of areas in economics. In addition to his work on production under risk and uncertainty, he is actively pursuing research in a number of topics in labour economics, development economics and applied econometrics.", "project": ["The state-contingent approach to the Noah\u2019s Ark problem", "A Minimum Distance and The Generalised EKS Approaches to Multilateral Comparisons of Prices and Real Incomes", "Estimating state-contingent Production Frontiers", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Estimating efficiency effects in a panel data stochastic frontier model", "year": "2019", "source": "Journal of productivity analysis, vol. 53, pp. 163-180", "authors": ["Paul S", "Sriram Shankar"]}, {"title": "Household Food Insecurity and Maternal and Child Nutritional Status: Evidence from Maharashtra", "year": "2019", "source": "Review of Income and Wealth, vol. 65, no. 1, pp. S63-S101", "authors": ["Maitra C", "Maitra C", "Sethi V", "Sriram Shankar"]}, {"title": "Household Food Insecurity and Maternal and Child Nutritional Status: Evidence from Maharashtra", "year": "2019", "source": "Review of Income and Wealth, vol. 65, no. 1, pp. S63-S101", "authors": ["Maitra C", "Maitra C", "Sethi V", "Sriram Shankar"]}, {"title": "Estimating Efficiency Effects in a Panel Data Stochastic Frontier Model.
