It is my second major research project following a decade of engagement with the microfinance industry. My first book,\u00a0Social Collateral: women and microfinance in Paraguay\u2019s smuggling economy\u00a0(University of California Press,\u00a02015) is an ethnographic account of freewheeling frontier capitalism in Paraguay\u2019s triple-frontier with Argentina and Brazil. Taken together, these two research projects offer a sustained study of economic interdependency. My research agenda asks: how and under what conditions are people collectively obligated in everyday economic practice? What value systems compel people to knit and ravel these economic interdependencies, and with what effects? Insurance is an obvious outgrowth from my research on microcredit \u201csocial collateral\u201d and collective indebtedness, since insurance explicitly aims to pool and spread risk while transferring liability. Building on my prior research, this DECRA project interrogates the consequential differences between modes of sharing risk and promising security in financial systems and otherwise. \u00a0I talk about my research on anthropology of finance in conversation with the Deakin Anthropology Podcast series -- you can listen in here:https://soundcloud.com/anthro-deakin/ep-22-schuster-mattioli"], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "The Bottlenecks of Free Trade: Paraguay", "year": "2019", "source": "s Mau Cars and Contraband Markets in the Triple Frontier'Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 498-517", "authors": ["Caroline Schuster"]}, {"title": "The Indebted Wage: Putting Financial Products to Work in Paraguay", "year": "2019", "source": "s Tri-Border Area'AQ Anthropological Quarterly, vol. 92, no. 3, pp. 729-756", "authors": ["Caroline Schuster"]}, {"title": "Spies like us", "year": "2017", "source": "Ethnography, vol.
