My training in Cardiology was at The Canberra Hospital before subspecializing in Cardiac Electrophysiology at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. I completed my PhD at The University of Adelaide under the mentorship of Professor Prashanthan Sanders and post-doctoral fellowship in advanced Cardiac Electrophysiology at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania under the mentorship of Professor Francis Marchlinski.My PhD (Australian Postgraduate award) comprised of a series of studies that were awarded several accolades including Eric Prystowsky clinical research award at Heart Rhythm Society (2014), 3 Late Breaking Trials (2015), and Young Investigator Awards at the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand and American Heart Association. My doctoral studies led to an invited talk in a plenary session at Heart Rhythm Society (2014) and 3 publications in the highest impact Cardiology journal (JACC- Impact factor 17.8). I was honored with Young Author Achievement Award (Parmley Award) at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting. I was awarded Neil Hamilton Fairley Fellowship by NHMRC for postdoctoral study (2015-2017) which I have completed under the mentorship of Professor Francis Marchlinski at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania, USA. Prof Marchlinski is one of the pioneers in cardiac electrophysiology and his team has been at the forefront of understanding the mechanisms of various heart rhythm disorders and developing techniques to treat patients. The Clinical Electrophysiology Fellowship program at the hospital of University of Pennsylvania is highly sought and prestigious fellowship program.I have been fortunate to have been mentored by two leaders in the field of cardiac electrophysiology. This has provided me with the skills ranging from clinical competency, translational research, people/group management, leadership and creative fund raising. I have been recognized as a promising leader by all major cardiovascular societies such as American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, Heart Rhythm Society and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.Since 2018, I have established Cardiac Electrophysiology services at the Canberra Hospital that provides a world class service to patients with complex arrhythmias. I have commenced EP fellowship program through ANU and continue to make significant contribution in cardiovascular research with ongoing national and international collaboration.", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "awareness on cytology procedure in oral cancer detection among undergraduates an institutional study", "year": 2017, "source": "journal of experimental therapeutics and oncology", "authors": [{"name": "g ramesh"}, {"name": "rajeev pathak"}, {"name": "sunita pathak"}, {"name": "amrita raj"}, {"name": "amit kumar"}, {"name": "anuradha katiyar"}], "id": 145535862}, {"title": "electric field maker and breaker of molecular co operativity the paradigm of ch3oh h 2 o n n 1 4 hetero clusters", "year": 2015, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "rajeev pathak"}]}, {"title": "current views on periodontitis and its theatrical association with coronary heart disease", "year": 2014, "source": "nigerian journal of cardiology", "authors": [{"name": "rajeev pathak"}, {"name": "saurabh wahi"}, {"name": "abhishek sinha"}, {"name": "shradha wahi"}], "id": 2764495754}], "ANDS-Grants": [{"description": "Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) is a common cause of heart failure and sudden death.
