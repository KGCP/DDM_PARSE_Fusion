This allows me to express Gromov-Witten invariants as a sum of contributions from tropical curves, where the contribution from each tropical curve is calculated from relative invariants associated to the vertices of the curve.The mathematical formulation of this uses exploded manifolds, which are related to log geometry and tropical geometry. A large amount of my work has gone towards defining the category of exploded manifolds and proving the properties required for Gromov-Witten invariants in the category of exploded manifolds."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "De Rham theory of exploded manifolds", "year": "2018", "source": "Geometry and Topology, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 1-54", "authors": ["Brett Parker"]}, {"title": "Three Dimensional Tropical Correspondence Formula", "year": "2017", "source": "Communications in Mathematical Physics, vol. 353, no. 2, pp. 791-819", "authors": ["Brett Parker"]}, {"title": "Holomorphic curves in exploded manifolds: Compactness", "year": "2015", "source": "Advances in Mathematics, vol. 283, pp. 377-457", "authors": ["Brett Parker"]}, {"title": "Log geometry and exploded manifolds", "year": "2012", "source": "Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universit\u00c3\u00a4t Hamburg, vol. 82, no. 1, pp. 43-81", "authors": ["Brett Parker"]}, {"title": "Exploded Manifolds", "year": "2012", "source": "Advances in Mathematics, vol. 229, no. 6, pp. 3256-3319", "authors": ["Brett Parker"]}]}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "zn tbip h2tbip 5 tert butyl isophthalic acid a highly stable guest free microporous metal organic framework with unique gas separation capability", "year": 2006, "source": "journal of the american chemical society", "authors": [{"name": "long pan", "affiliation": "rutgers university"}, {"name": "brett parker", "affiliation": "rutgers university"}, {"name": "xiaoying huang", "affiliation": "rutgers university"}, {"name": "david h olson", "affiliation": "rutgers university"}, {"name": "jeong yong lee", "affiliation": "rutgers university"}, {"name": "jing li", "affiliation": "rutgers university"}], "id": 111155417}, {"title": "the pmp22 gene and its related diseases", "year": 2013, "source": "molecular neurobiology", "authors": [{"name": "jun li", "affiliation": "vanderbilt university"}, {"name": "brett parker", "affiliation": "vanderbilt university"}, {"name": "colin martyn", "affiliation": "vanderbilt university"}, {"name": "chandramohan natarajan", "affiliation": "vanderbilt university"}, {"name": "jiasong guo", "affiliation": "vanderbilt university"}], "id": 194681035}, {"title": "gromov witten invariants of exploded manifolds", "year": 2011, "source": "arxiv symplectic geometry", "authors": [{"name": "brett parker"}], "id": 2594936402}, {"title": "holomorphic curves in exploded manifolds compactness", "year": 2009, "source": "arxiv symplectic geometry", "authors": [{"name": "brett parker"}], "id": 2594936402}, {"title": "holomorphic curves in exploded manifolds compactness", "year": 2015, "source": "advances in mathematics", "authors": [{"name": "brett parker"}], "id": 122441808}, {"title": "is death different to federal judges", "year": 2020, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "brett parker", "affiliation": "stanford university"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "death penalty statutes and murder rates evidence from synthetic controls", "year": 2020, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "brett parker", "affiliation": "stanford university"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "the uncertain future of felon disenfranchisement", "year": 2019, "source": "missouri law review", "authors": [{"name": "bruce e cain"}, {"name": "brett parker"}], "id": 2764468503}, {"title": "the uncertain future of felon disenfranchisement", "year": 2020, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "bruce e cain", "affiliation": "university of california berkeley"}, {"name": "brett parker", "affiliation": "stanford university"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "can we identify patients appropriate for same day discharge after laparoscopic fundoplication", "year": 2021, "source": "journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques", "authors": [{"name": "brett parker", "affiliation": "johns hopkins university"}, {"name": "kristin w beard"}, {"name": "reid fletcher"}, {"name": "ahmed sharata"}, {"name": "dolores t muller"}, {"name": "kelly r haisley"}, {"name": "kevin m reavis"}, {"name": "daniel davila bradley"}, {"name": "steven r demeester"}, {"name": "lee l swanstrom"}, {"name": "christy m dunst"}], "id": 21837735}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
