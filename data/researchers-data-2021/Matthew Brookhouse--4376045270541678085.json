I currently teach first-year research methods, with a specific focus upon helping students make the important connection between the theory of inferential statistics and their application. I am continuing to explore the genotype-by-[CO2] interactions in eucalypt species and have ongoing dendrochronological, and silvicultural research interests.\u00a0 I am also leading collaborative research efforts focussed on understanding wood-borer induced dieback of snow-gum woodland in the Australian Alps.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Survival of native seedlings planted by
