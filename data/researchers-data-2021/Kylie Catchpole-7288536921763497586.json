It will incorporate nanostructured layers between the cells that selectively trap different wavelengths of light, maximising light absorption in the top cell. This will make it possible to use a very thin top cell, reducing the requirements on electronic quality of the material. This project will also develop self-assembly techniques to enable the new nanostructures to be fabricated quickly and cheaply but with a high degree of control. Such cells will allow open the door to higher efficiencies, and lower costs, than is achievable with conventional solar cells.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT130100916", "id": "517326", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT130100916", "researchers": ["A/Prof Kylie Catchpole"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 843636, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2013, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:39Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:20Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT130100916", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT130100916", "FT130100916"], "subjects": ["ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING", "photonic", "photovoltaic", "plasmonic"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517326"}]}, {"description": "This project will lead to the development of extremely thin solar cells made of novel low-cost materials, which would likely reduce the cost of photovoltaic technology.
