Aquatic parasites rely on chemical cues to locate and infect their host. This project will target the aquatic host-parasite interaction to decipher these chemical cues, so that future tools may be developed to suppress this interplay. This project expects to contribute imperative basic knowledge for the future control of the intestinal parasite disease, Schistosomiasis, a devastating tropical disease.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180103694", "id": "1317070", "institutions": ["University of the Sunshine Coast"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103694", "researchers": ["Dr Scott Cummins", "Dr Tianfang Wang", "Prof Kenneth Storey", "Prof Donald McManus"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 270012, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:36Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of the Sunshine Coast"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103694", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103694", "DP180103694"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1317070"}]}]}
