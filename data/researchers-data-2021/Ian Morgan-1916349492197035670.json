We also aim to exam in detail, risk factors associated with myopia, such as parental myopia, living conditions and educational pressures, particularly those associated with reading and other forms of near-work. Increased understanding of factors leading to increasing myopia prevalence may enable design of preventive strategies that could limit future increases in the ocurrence of myopia in Australia. The prevalence of myopia is increasing world-wide. In many Asian countries, it has reached epidemic proportions (80-90%) in young, educated people. In many other countries close to half the younger population is now short-sighted. Data from the Blue Mountains Eye Study and Melbourne Visual Impairment Project in older persons have suggested that the prevalence of myopia is increasing in Australia. Comparison with our recent pilot study on school children indicates that myopia prevalence has increased 2 to 3-fold in recent decades. Myopia or short-sightedness is now one of the five major causes of blindness. In countries where the prevalence of myopia is high, it is one of the top three. Myopia requires expensive optical and-or surgical correction of the refractive error for visual functioning. Unfortunately correction does not prevent the development of visual impairment and blindness from complications of myopia. Late in life, even low myopia is associated with an increased risk of both glaucoma and cataract. Myopia therefore imposes additional major health costs because of the burden of eye disease and the support costs for people affected by myopia-associated low vision or blindness. With increasing prevalence, the health care costs of myopia are likely to continue to rise in Australia.", "title": "The Sydney Myopia Study: Prevalence and risk factors for myopia and other eye conditions in school-age children.", "id": "78078", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/253732", "researchers": ["Prof Paul Mitchell", "Prof Wayne Smith", "Prof Kathryn Rose", "Prof Ian Morgan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 596375, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:07Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:43:13Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Paul Mitchell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/253732", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/253732", "253732"], "subjects": ["321202", "Public Health", "epidemiology", "myopia", "ophthalmology", "public health", "vision disorders, blindness", "vision disorders, refractive"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/78078"}]}, {"title": "Effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation from long-term mobile phone use on vision and hearing", "id": "76194", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/163627", "researchers": ["Prof Ted Maddess", "Prof Paul Mitchell", "Prof Jie Jin Wang", "Prof Wayne Smith", "Prof Kathryn Rose", "Prof Ian Morgan"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 309005, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:24Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:14Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Paul Mitchell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/163627", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/163627", "163627"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "RFEM radiation", "epidemiology", "mobile phones", "non-linear systems analysis", "vision & Hearing"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76194"}]}, {"title": "Sydney Adolescent Vascular and Eye Study", "id": "95765", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/512530", "researchers": ["Prof Paul Mitchell", "Prof Jie Jin Wang", "Prof Victoria Flood", "Prof Wayne Smith", "Prof Kathryn Rose", "Prof Ian Morgan"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 1277313.5, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2008, "endDate": 2011, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-17T04:49:05Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:01Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Paul Mitchell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/512530", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/512530", "512530"], "subjects": ["321206", "Blood pressure", "Cardiovascular risk", "Childhood health", "Eye diseases", "Microvascular", "Adolescent health and wellbeing", "Cardiovascular risk factors", "Eyes and vision", "Microvascular disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95765"}]}]}
