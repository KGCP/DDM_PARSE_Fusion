Imogen graduated from University of London and undertook her physician's training in the UK before moving to Australia to complete her specialist training in intensive care. Appointed initially as an intensive care specialist at Royal Prince Alfred but then moved to Canberra in 1999 to take up the Directorship of the Intensive Care Unit at the Canberra Hospital. After 15 years as their Director and building the unit from 2 specialists to 11 specialists and securing C24 accreditation from the College of Intensive Care Medicine, she moved to being the Deputy Dean at the ANU Medical School in 2014. Just prior to moving to the Medical School, she won the prestigious Harkness Fellowship in Health Policy and Practice and spent 12 months at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Clinicians\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd accounts of communication with patients in end-of-life care contexts: A systematic review", "year": "2020", "source": "Patient Education and Counseling, vol. 103, no. 10, pp. 1913-1921", "authors": ["Scholz B", "Goncharov L", "Emmerich N", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "End-of-life care in an Australian acute hospital: a retrospective observational study", "year": "2019", "source": "Internal Medical Journal, vol. 49, no. 11, pp. 1400-1405", "authors": ["Maubach N", "Batten M", "Jones S", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Mobilisation is feasible in intensive care patients receiving vasoactive therapy: An observational study", "year": "2019", "source": "Australian Critical Care, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 139-146", "authors": ["Rebel A", "Marzano V", "Green M", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Long-term follow-up for Psychological stRess in Intensive CarE (PRICE) survivors: Study protocol for a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study in Australian intensive care units", "year": "2019", "source": "BMJ Open, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. Article number e023310", "authors": ["Rai S", "Brown R", "van Haren F", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "The prevalence of perceptions of mismatch between treatment intensity and achievable goals of care in the intensive care unit: a cross-sectional study", "year": "2019", "source": "Intensive Care Medicine, vol. 45, no. 4, pp. 459-467", "authors": ["Anstey M", "Litton E", "Trevenen M", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Recognising and managing dying patients in the acute hospital setting: can we do better?", "year": "2019", "source": "Internal Medicine Journal, vol. 49, no. 1, pp. 119-122", "authors": ["Gunasekaran B", "Scott C", "Ducharlet K", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "comparison of the opinions of intensive care unit staff and family members of the treatment intensity received by patients admitted to an intensive care unit: A multicentre survey", "year": "2018", "source": "Australian Critical Care, vol. 32, pp. 378-382", "authors": ["Anstey M", "Litton E", "Jha N", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Making soft intelligence hard: A multi-site qualitative study of challenges relating to voice about safety concerns", "year": "2018", "source": "BMJ Quality and Safety, vol. 27, no. 9, pp. 710-717", "authors": ["Martin G", "Aveling E", "Campbell A", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Women in Intensive Care study: a preliminary assessment of international data on female representation in the ICU physician workforce, leadership and academic positions", "year": "2018", "source": "Critical Care, vol. 22, no. 211, pp. 1-9", "authors": ["Venkatesh B", "Mehta S", "Angus D", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Discrepancy between factors associated with long-term outcome in very old patients referred to the intensive care unit, and prevalence of treatment limitations", "year": "2018", "source": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, vol. 46, no. 3, pp. 344-346pp", "authors": ["Hoffman K", "Loong B", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "End-of-life care of oncology inpatients: Are we getting it right?", "year": "2018", "source": "Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology, vol. 14, no. 5, pp. e528-e534pp", "authors": ["Batten M", "Nguyen B", "Burke B", "Imogen Mitchell"]}, {"title": "Walking for the weekend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Is there a weekend effect for mobilisation practices in ICU?

concentration of sugar in the blood is often increased in patients in intensive care and patients with increased blood sugar levels are more likely to die. A recent study performed in a Belgian intensive care unit found that using high doses of insulin to lower blood sugars levels to normal increased the number of patients who survived. The chance of surviving to leave hospital was increased from 89% to 93%. Whilst the result is very encouraging, Intensive Care Specialists in Australia are unsure if the treatment would work in their patients because of differences in the types of patients found in intensive care units in Australia, and because of other treatment given to the patients in the Belgian study. In particular the doctors in the Belgian unit studied only patients who had had operations and gave large amounts of intravenous sugar to their patients. This is not normally done in Australian Intensive Care Units and the safety of giving high dose insulin to patients not receiving large amounts of intravenous sugar is not known. This is of particular interest as reducing blood glucose to abnormally low levels can cause serious side effects and even result in permanent brain damage. The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society proposes to conduct a new study involving 4,000 patients from intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand and will study all patients regardless of whether or not they have had an operation. These patients will be randomly assigned to receive insulin to control blood sugar levels to normal or to slightly above normal levels as has been tradition in intensive care units around the world. Outcome and serious side effects will be closely monitored. The results will be available within three years of starting the study, and these are likely to influence the treatment of the majority of patients admitted to intensive care units both in Australia and worldwide.", "title": "A randomised controlled trial of normoglycaemia versus conventional glycaemic control in Intensive Care Unit patients.", "id": "77244", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/293201", "researchers": ["Prof Bruce Robinson", "Dr Imogen Mitchell", "Prof Simon Finfer", "Prof John Myburgh", "Prof Rinaldo Bellomo"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 1773507.5, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:23Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:45Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Simon Finfer"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/293201", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/293201", "293201"], "subjects": ["321009", "Glycaemic control", "Insulin administration", "Intensive Care", "Randomised controlled trial", "Critical illness", "Mortality", "Sepsis"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/77244"}]}, {"description": "Vital signs are the most common assessment technique employed in healthcare.
