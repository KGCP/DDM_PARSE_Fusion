One of them is cytolytic lymphocytes, cells that can recognize and destroy virus-infected target cells. These cells use, besides other molecules, enzymes called granzymes to kill target cells by inducing suicide in them. We intend to investigate if those granzymes can protect cytolytic lymphocytes themselves from being infected by viruses and turned into viral factories. We are going to use a model of a natural infection, ectromelia, mouse pox. Mouse pox is fatal in resistant strains of mice if the genes for the two dominant granzymes are deleted. This indicates that granzymes are essential for fighting this viral disease. We will explore in which cells of the immune system granzymes are expressed and whether virus entry into a cell can actually trigger their expression. Furthermore, we will investigate how the granzymes inhibit virus infection within the infected cell to determine whether the mechanisms involved resemble those used by cytolytic lymphocytes in killing of target cells (i.e. degradation of DNA and mitochondrial damage), or whether they represent entirely new facets of granzyme function. Finally, using viruses from a number of different families, we will establish whether these functions of granzymes also contribute to protection from other viral infections. An understanding of the role of these granzymes in the innate immune response, i.e. before antigen specific T cell and antibody responses are fully activated, is of great significance as it may allow us to manipulate this particular anti-viral response and thus enhance survival and reduce morbidity in viral infections.", "title": "Role of granzymes in innate immunity", "id": "100719", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366742", "researchers": ["Arno Mullbacher", "Dr Matthias Regner"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 500008.8, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:51:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:57:14Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Arno Mullbacher"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366742", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366742", "366742"], "subjects": ["IMMUNOLOGY", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "apoptosis", "cytolytic mechanisms", "innate immunity", "viral immunology", "inhibition of virus replication", "protection from viral infection", "recovery from viral infection", "virus-induced immunopathology"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100719"}]}, {"description": "Although there are new antiviral drugs that appear to be effective against influenza virus, the far more costeffective and efficient means to combat an influenza pandemic would be by vaccination. Current influenza vaccines employ virus preparations that are inactivated by chemical treatment. The inactivated vaccines, which function mostly by inducing antibody against the virus, have to be reformulated almost every year to take account of the changing virus because the antibodies recognize the viral surface which is prone to mutation. Accordingly, in terms of the threatening H5N1 avian influenza pandemic, it is not known if an inactivated vaccine based on the circulating H5N1 strain will be effective if the virus mutates to adapt to efficient growth and spread in the human population. In contrast to the antibody response against influenza virus, the cytotoxic T cell response is broadly crossreactive between heterologous influenza virus strains. Live virus infection efficiently induces cytotoxic T cell immunity which plays an important role in reducing disease severity and mortality following infection with a second, heterologous influenza virus, although infection per se is not prevented. Accordingly, vaccination strategies that elicit cytotoxic T cell memory should be given urgent consideration in the preparation against an influenza pandemic. We have found that the use of gamma-irradiation (in contrast to chemical treatment) for the preparation of inactivated experimental vaccines against influenza and other viruses does not destroy the ability of the vaccines to elicit cytotoxic T cell immunity. The gamma-ray inactivated vaccines conferred protection against lethal challenge with heterologous influenza virus strains in mice. This proposal is aimed at extending this novel finding to avian influenza viruses and to uncover the mechanisms involved in the cytotoxic T cell immunogenicity of gamma-ray inactivated vaccines.", "title": "Gamma-ray inactivated influenza A virus vaccine for cross-protective T cell immunity", "id": "95880", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410227", "researchers": ["A/Pr Mario Lobigs", "Arno Mullbacher"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 239963.8, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:06Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Arno Mullbacher"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410227", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410227", "410227"], "subjects": ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Cellular immunity", "Cytotoxic T cells", "Infectious disease", "Influenza", "Vaccines"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95880"}]}]}
