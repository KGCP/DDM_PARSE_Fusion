individual record data (microdata) that can be released to external researchers. \u00a0I'm interested in statistical methods to modify the original microdata before dissemination, so we can protect both disclosure risk (for example, identification of units in the study) and preserve the analytic validity of the original data. \u00a0Some specific topics:empirical assessment of disclosure risksynthetic data techniques and building flexible synthesis models\u00a0applied case studies so we can better understand the relationship between disclosure risk and preserving analytic validityMissing data techniquesNo data set is foolproof from missing values or erroneous values. \u00a0In a survey, sometimes questions are skipped. \u00a0In a clinical trial, sometimes patients drop out. \u00a0If a scientific measurement is recorded with error, then the true value is missing. \u00a0Can we just ignore the missing data? \u00a0Usually not because the missingness mechanism is related to other variables in our study. \u00a0 I'm interested in using statistical methods to handle missing data, beyond ignoring the missing values. \u00a0Applied statisticsSome of the best theoretical and methodological research in statistics has come out of solving 'real' problems. \u00a0I'm interested in how statistics is used in other disciplines, and whether currently used methods, or assumptions made, need to be challenged."], "biography": "BActStud/BComm (ANU), FIAA, PhD - Statistics (Harvard University)", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Comparing and contrasting knowledge of
