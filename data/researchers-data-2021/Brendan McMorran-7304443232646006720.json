Medical Proteomics"], "interest": ["Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted between people by mosquitoes, and infects the liver and red blood cells; clinical symptoms arise during the erythrocytic stage. Infections can result in flu-like symptoms and periodic fevers, which if unchecked, increase in severity and can further develop into serious life-threatening conditions, including severe anaemia, respiratory distress and coma. Millions of people living in the tropics are at risk of infection and young children, particularly those living in Africa, are most susceptible; the disease kills at least 1 million people each year. The widespread development of drug-resistant parasites is hampering ongoing control and elimination programs, motivating urgency for new ways to combat the disease.\u00a0The main focus of my research is to understand the\u00a0host response to malarial infection. Malaria survival has been a major driver in\u00a0the evolutionary history of humans and many protective mechanisms have arisen that determine an individuals\u2019 susceptibility to infection. One such mechanism involves platelets, which are able to bind parasite-infected cells and kill the parasite within. Understanding the molecular basis and clinical importance of these observations are major focuses in my group. I am also interested in discovering novel genes and pathways\u00a0that protect the host during an infection, and\u00a0using this knowledge to develop so-called host-directed therapies for malaria."], "biography": "I am a graduate of The University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand and hold BSc (Hons) and PhD degrees in biochemistry. I conducted postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland (1997-2006) on cystic fibrosis and host response to lung disease. Since 2006 I have lead research on the protective role of platelets in malarial infection, whilst working at the Menzies Research Institute, University of Tasmania (Senior Research Fellow; 2006-2012) and at the Australian School of Advanced Medicine, Macquarie University (Associate Professor; 2012-2014). I was appointed as an Associate Professor at the John Curtin School of Medicine (JCSMR), Australian National University (ANU) in 2014.", "project": ["A hosted-directed approach to malarial treatment.", "Critical to an individual\u2019s ability to survive an infection are the genetic makeup and ability to mount an appropriate protective response. Several genetic polymorphisms are associated with increased resistance to malarial infection, and these polymorphisms are common in populations living in malaria endemic regions. Compared to the short effective half-lives of modern antimalarial drugs, genetic-based protection, which has arisen through natural selection, has provided protection for millennia. This is because the anti-malarial effects are outside the genetic control of the parasite, whereas all current drugs target parasite molecules; variant parasite strains that modify the drug or mutate its target protein can (and have) rapidly arisen through their own selective bottlenecks. We propose that drugs that mimic host genetic-based protection will be highly effective and resistance-proof antimalarial agents. We call this approach host-directed therapy.", "", "Host red enzymes as targets for host-directed antimalarial therapy.", "During its residence in the red blood cell, the Plasmodium parasite scavenges and co-opts many host cell molecules to sustain its own growth requirements. The aim of this project is to develop drugs that \u2018starve\u2019 parasite of these molecules, and thereby act as host-directed antimalarial therapies. Amongst these molecules are enzymes used by progenitor red cells to synthesise haem. We have discovered, using a combination of genetics, bioinformatics and molecular biology that these host enzymes are essential for the parasite. Inhibiting their functions by genetic targeting or small molecule inhibitors produces a potent anti-malarial effect. Our current work aims to evaluate which enzymes are most suited as targets for host-directed therapy, and to develop novel inhibitors as lead antimalarial compounds.", "Relevant papers:", "Smith CM, Jerkovic A, Puy H, Winship I, Deybach JC, Gouya L, van Dooren G, Goodman CD, Sturm A, Manceau H, McFadden GI, David P, Mercereau-Puijalon O, Burgio G, McMorran BJ, Foote SJ.

This was a completely novel finding at the time as platelets are traditionally thought of as merely mediators of haemostasis and clot formation. However a large body of evidence now indicates their importance in many immunological and host defence functions, including malaria protection.\u00a0 Platelets preferentially bind to Plasmodium-infected cells, become activated and release a molecule called Platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is cytotoxic to the parasite. The PF4 molecule enters the cell and parasite via red cell molecule called Duffy.\u00a0 Parasites growing in red cells that lack Duffy are killed by the platelet. These discoveries implicate a relationship between the Duffy-negative allele and rates of P. falciparum infection; both are highly prevalent in African populations. Our current work aims to address a number of important questions relating to these findings, including the molecular mechanisms involved in the platelet killing function, the reasons for platelet loss early in malarial infection, and the occurrence of platelet-mediated parasite killing amongst different human populations.", "Relevant papers:", "McMorran BJ, Marshall VM, de Graaf C, et al.
