Although my interests extend to other subjects in Machine Learning and Automated Reasoning, my expertise lies mostly within planning. I study and develop AI technologies that enable machines to reason about deliberations in the world, and to reason about how to extend their knowledge about the world intelligently. Subjects where I have published works include: exploiting sub-problem symmetries -- 'descriptive quotient', computing plan-length upper bounds -- 'sublist diameter', stochastic local search (SLS) \u00a0procedures for Boolean SAT(isfiability) -- 'gNovelty+', SLS for Vertex Cover -- 'COver Edges Ramdomly', compact and efficient representations for SAT-based planning -- 'split-encoding', decision-theoretic planning and (relational-)reinforcement learning with non-Markovian rewards -- various Linear Temporal Logics. I've also done published research on aesthetic criteria in solving vehicle routing problems, and game-theoretic cost allocations in logistics.Industrial application areas I worked in include transportation of fast moving consumer goods, product stocking policies and recommendation."], "biography": "In mid 2015 I co-founded Red Analytics PTY LTD (a.k.a. HIVERY), a Data61 spinout supported by the coca-cola founders platform. I was a senior researcher with the Data61 (NICTA) lab in Canberra from August of 2011. Prior to that I was a research fellow with the Intelligent Robotics Lab at the University of Birmingham 2008-2011; There I worked on a project investigating cognitive robots that could self-understand and self-extend. I was a researcher with the NICTA lab in Brisbane 2006-2008; There, I worked on fundamental research in AI Search, and simulation studies of city wide evacuation planning. I have also held adjunct positions at Griffith University since 2006. I am the primary author of NRMDPP, runner up in the probabilistic track of the 2004 International Planning Competition. I am a co-author of gNovelty+, winner of the \"Random\" category at the 2007 International SAT competition.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "TIL-Relaxed Heuristic for Planning with Time Windows", "year": "2018", "source": "28th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2018), ed.
