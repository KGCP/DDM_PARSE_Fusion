Brain injury has significant health, economic and societal costs. Despite breakthroughs in brain science, regulatory approaches aimed at preventing and treating brain injury vary and have disparate outcomes, even among at risk populations. By studying brain injury, this research aims to discover how inequality affects public health interventions. Findings are expected to provide empirical insight into the challenges of establishing effective programs and how to overcome them, which can improve regulatory responses in and beyond Australia.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE170100819", "id": "942694", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100819", "researchers": ["Dr Kathryn Henne"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 357000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:57Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100819", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100819", "DE170100819"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/942694"}]}]}
