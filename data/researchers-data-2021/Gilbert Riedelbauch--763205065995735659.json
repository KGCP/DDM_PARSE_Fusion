The project links new materials and processes to my studio based practice as a designer/maker. I experiment with computer controlled (CNC) routing of flat material to form 3d objects. High performing composite sheeting is used in in this process as the base material. \u00a0I research into the design of CNC cutting patterns and translate these into digital files, these in turn control the CNC router's path. Of special interest is the effect of the machine cut pattern as it guides the manual shaping of the sheet into a 3d object. The surface treatment is important as the appearance of the finished object will convert this material from its industrial appearance to the manually formed and finished object. First results have been displayed/published at 'Elements Metal', CraftACT, Canberra and 'Cheongju International Craft Biannual', Korea."], "publication": [{"title": "Wave 1 red", "year": "2013", "source": "(Integrating New Technologies and traditional skills)honourable mention at 8th international craft competition - Cheongju, South Korea, Catalogue \u00a9 2013 Cheongju International Craft Biennale", "authors": ["Gilbert Riedelbauch"]}, {"title": "Intensity of Purpose", "year": "2013", "source": "(Light Objects)Embracing innovation, group exhibition curated by Allison Bell, Canberra Museum and Gallery, Australia.", "authors": ["Gilbert Riedelbauch"]}, {"title": "Knicks 1 light", "year": "2013", "source": "(Light Objects)Inhabit-living in Design, group exhibition curated by Richard Wood, CraftACT: Craft and Design Centre, Canberra, Australia.", "authors": ["Gilbert Riedelbauch"]}, {"title": "De sign ed 2", "year": "2012", "source": "ANU School of Art Gallery(Integrating New Technologies and traditional skills), curated group exhibition.
