My methodological research centers on causal multistate models and demographic microsimulation.\u00a0Current areas of work include:Generational changes in health across low-, middle-, and high-income contextsInterrelations between mental, physical, and cognitive healthExposure to life-course trauma and late-life health and well-beingMy methodological research interests include:Demographic applications of microsimulation modelsCausal methods for population health researchFormal demography of longevity"], "biography": "More information available at:\u00a0https://collinfpayne.com/", "project": ["Advancing Research on Healthy Longevity in Australia and the Asia Pacific.
