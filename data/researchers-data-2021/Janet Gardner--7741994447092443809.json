This phenomenon has been interpreted as a response to rising temperatures in the context of Bergmann\u2019s Rule, originally proposed to explain geographical variation in body size. Changes in body size have important implications for the thermal tolerances and energetics of species because body size directly affects energy and water requirements for thermoregulation and life history traits. Thus, changing body size will have implications for individual fitness and population persistence in the face of climate change. We are currently quantifying the nature and extent of recent size responses to environmental change and investigating underlying mechanisms at a continental scale in Australian birds. We combine the use of long-term morphological data sets with ptilochronology (study of feather growth rates), ecosystem productivity and climate data to understand the factors involved in shaping size variation.", "Key publications:", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Spatial and temporal variation in morphology in\r\nAustralian whistlers and shrike-thrushes: is climate\r\nchange causing larger appendages?", "year": "2020", "source": "Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, vol. 130, no. 1, pp. 101-113", "authors": ["Onley I", "Janet Gardner", "Symonds M"]}, {"title": "Using different body size measures can lead to different conclusions about the effects of climate change", "year": "2020", "source": "Journal of Biogeography, vol. 47, no. 8, pp. 1687-1697", "authors": ["Bailey L", "Kruuk L", "Allen R", "Janet Gardner"]}, {"title": "Weighing the cost: the impact of serial heatwaves on body mass in a small Australian passerine", "year": "2019", "source": "Journal of Avian Biology, vol. 50, no. 11, pp. e02355", "authors": ["Sharpe L", "Cale B", "Janet Gardner"]}, {"title": "ustralian songbird body size tracks climate variation: 82 species over 50 years", "year": "2019", "source": "Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B: Biological Sciences, vol. 286, pp. 1-10", "authors": ["Janet Gardner", "Amano T", "Peters A"]}, {"title": "Impacts of recent climate change on terrestrial flora and fauna: Some emerging Australian examples", "year": "2019", "source": "Austral Ecology, vol. 44, pp. 3-27", "authors": ["Hoffmann A", "Rymer P", "Byrne M", "Janet Gardner"]}, {"title": "ssociations between changing climate and body condition over decades in two southern hemisphere passerine birds", "year": "2018", "source": "Climate Change Responses, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 1-14", "authors": ["Janet Gardner", "Rowley E", "de Rebeira P"]}, {"title": "re long-term widespread avian body size changes related to food availability?
