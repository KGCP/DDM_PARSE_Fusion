In many cases, MR results from changes (mutations) in genes which regulate the development of the brain before birth. We are studying families with an inherited form of MR termed X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH) in which only boys are affected. In addition to intellectual disability, boys with XH also have poor pituitary function resulting in short stature and slow metabolism. In severe cases, where the pituitary has failed to form completely, these babies are extremely ill and in some instances do not survive. We have previously shown that XH is due to an unusual change in the SOX3 gene in which the number of consecutive alanine residues is increased above a critical threshold (polyalanine expansion mutations). Similar mutations have recently been identified in several other genes that also cause severe birth defects. However, little is currently known about how polyalanine expansion mutations cause these disorders. The overall aim of this proposal is generate a mouse model for this disorder. Analysis of these mice will help us to answer many unresolved questions about this disorder including: How does the mutant protein cause this disorder? Which parts of the brain and pituitary are affected and how is their function altered? How does the mutant protein affect other genes and proteins in the cell? Ultimately, we hope that this mouse model will help us to develop new and improved therapies for XH and other disorders that are caused by alanine expansion mutations.", "title": "Identifying the pathological mechanism of polyalanine expansion mutations in the X-linked Hypopituitarism gene SOX3", "id": "77698", "institutions": ["University of Adelaide"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465401", "researchers": ["Prof Paul Thomas"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 402846.75, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-17T04:48:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:59Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Adelaide"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Paul Thomas"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465401", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465401", "465401"], "subjects": ["270205", "brain development", "developmental genetics", "gene targeting", "pituitary gland", "transcription factor", "Growth hormone deficiency", "Mental retardation", "Neurodevelopmental disorders", "Neuroendocrine differentiation"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/77698"}]}, {"description": "It has recently become apparent that we all make a substance in the lungs called nitric oxide.

Formation of the pituitary gland occurs during development of the foetus. This process requires a specific set of genes that shape the pituitary and allow the hormone secreting cells to arise.

In severe cases, where the pituitary has failed to form completely (panhypopituitarism), these babies are extremely ill and in some instances do not survive. We are studying the genes that belong to the Notch signalling pathway. These genes are important regulators of cell differentiation during the development of the brain, skin, bone and many other tissues. However, the role of the Notch signalling genes in pituitary development is not known. We have shown for the first time that these genes are active during pituitary development. To test the function of these genes in the pituitary, we will generate mouse models that either lack or inappropriately activate these genes. Our results will provide insight into the role of Notch Signalling genes in pituitary development in mice and humans. In this project, we also hope to identify cells in the pituitary that are able to give rise to multiple hormone secreting cell types.
