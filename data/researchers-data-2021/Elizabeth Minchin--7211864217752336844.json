As a member of the ARC-funded ANU-University of Melbourne 2010 Gallipoli Project I developed a strong research interest in\u00a0social memory and the landscape\u00a0of the Dardanelles region, which I am directing to new projects on myth and memory and landscape within that region, and their reception."], "biography": "My first career after graduating from Sydney University was as a secondary school teacher of languages ancient and modern. I subsequently completed an MA and PhD at the Australian National University in Ancient Greek literature (my PhD thesis was a study of the role that memory played in the composition of the Homeric epics) and joined the Classics staff in the Classics Program (now the Centre for Classical Studies) at the ANU. Teaching the languages and literature of Ancient Greece and Rome--that is, helping students to appreciate why the literature of these ancient cultures continues to be so influential--is what drives me. I have also enjoyed teaching classes in social history. The awards I have won for the quality of my teaching reflect my commitment to doing this well.", "project": ["1.
