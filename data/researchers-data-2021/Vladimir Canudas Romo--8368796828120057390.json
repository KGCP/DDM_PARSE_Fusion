I believe the future rise in life expectancy will still be heavily dependent on public health interventions, as it was the case in the past (sanitation, living standards, clean water, health-education, etc). However, also medical innovations will have a central part of this change. Demography, and more specifically the study of mortality by causes of death, will be at the center of this debate helping experts of other fields disentangle the contribution of the new advancements in both public health and clinical practices.\u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demography has a central role in the public debate because it informs about existent \u201cDisparities\u201d in populations. In the mortality/health research by causes of death mentioned above, I am also interested to study disparities occurring in time trends, for example the disproportional high levels of homicide mortality in Latin America, or existent mortality disparities among subpopulations, for example the mortality of people with mental disorders.\u00a0Analyzing the mortality disparities\u00a0among\u00a0different education, social and other subpopulations is also a key part of my work.\u00a0 - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Formal demography or the existent mathematical relations between demographic measures is also at the core of my interests: I would intend to continue developing new demographic measures and methods that help explicate the observed population phenomena in humans."], "biography": "", "project": ["https://demography.cass.anu.edu.au/life-expectancy-among-disease-diagnosed-life-left", "Life Expectancy among Disease-Diagnosed (LIFE LEFT) project.\u00a0By analysing national linkage data, we will identify gaps in longevity between those diagnosed and the general population.
