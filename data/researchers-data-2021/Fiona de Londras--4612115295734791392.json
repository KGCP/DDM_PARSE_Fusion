In exploring these matters, her work concentrates broadly on \u00a0terrorism/security and the\u00a0law, (comparative) constitutional law, human rights law, and gender and the law. Inevitably these themes sometimes overlap; much of her work on human rights law for example has taken place in, or develops further the work that Professor de Londras has done in, the security/counter-terrorism context.\u00a0Prof. de Londras\u2019 work strives to consider law in context, and almost always adopts a comparative approach drawing insights from comparative constitutional law in particular, but also international law and international human rights law. Professor de Londras\u2019 research work has been funded by the European Commission FP7 fund, the British Academy, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, and under the auspices of an ERC grant held in the Israel Democracy Institute. In 2017 Professor de Londras was awarded the Philip Leverhulme Prize in Law, which is supporting her full-time research agenda from November 2018-2021."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "fatal foetal abnormality irish constitutional law and mellet v ireland", "year": 2016, "source": "medical law review", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}], "id": 167467917}, {"title": "brexit and the british bill of rights", "year": 2017, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "tobias lock", "affiliation": "maynooth university"}, {"name": "tom gerald daly", "affiliation": "university of melbourne"}, {"name": "ed bates", "affiliation": "university of leicester"}, {"name": "christine bell", "affiliation": "university of edinburgh"}, {"name": "kanstantsin dzehtsiarou", "affiliation": "university of liverpool"}, {"name": "david edward"}, {"name": "murray hunt"}, {"name": "kagiaros dimitrios", "affiliation": "durham university"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "west virginia university college of law"}, {"name": "cormac mac amhlaigh", "affiliation": "university of edinburgh"}, {"name": "christopher mccrudden", "affiliation": "university of michigan"}, {"name": "christopher mccrudden", "affiliation": "university of california berkeley"}, {"name": "christopher mccrudden", "affiliation": "queen s university belfast"}, {"name": "anne smith", "affiliation": "ulster university"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "impossible floodgates and unworkable analogies in the irish abortion debate", "year": 2013, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "durham university"}, {"name": "laura graham"}]}, {"title": "impossible floodgates and unworkable analogies in the irish abortion debate", "year": 2013, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "west virginia university college of law"}, {"name": "laura graham", "affiliation": "durham university"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "abortion law reform in ireland a model for change", "year": 2015, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "mairead enright", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "vicky conway", "affiliation": "university of kent"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "west virginia university college of law"}, {"name": "mary donnelly", "affiliation": "university college cork"}, {"name": "ruth fletcher", "affiliation": "queen mary university of london"}, {"name": "natalie mcdonnell", "affiliation": "trinity college"}, {"name": "sheelagh mcguinness", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "claire murray", "affiliation": "university college cork"}, {"name": "sinead ring", "affiliation": "maynooth university"}, {"name": "sorcha ui chonnachtaigh", "affiliation": "keele university"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "abortion law reform in ireland a model for change", "year": 2015, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "mairead enright", "affiliation": "university of kent"}, {"name": "vicky conway", "affiliation": "dublin city university"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "durham university"}, {"name": "mary donnelly", "affiliation": "university college cork"}, {"name": "ruth fletcher", "affiliation": "queen mary university of london"}, {"name": "natalie mcdonnell"}, {"name": "sheelagh mcguinness", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "claire murray", "affiliation": "university college cork"}, {"name": "sinead ring", "affiliation": "university of kent"}, {"name": "sorcha ui chonnachtaigh", "affiliation": "keele university"}]}, {"title": "repealing the 8th", "year": 2018, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras"}, {"name": "mairead enright"}]}, {"title": "constitutionalizing fetal rights a salutary tale from ireland", "year": 2015, "source": "social science research network", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "university of birmingham"}, {"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "west virginia university college of law"}], "id": 2751751161}, {"title": "constitutionalizing fetal rights a salutary tale from ireland", "year": 2015, "source": "michigan journal of gender & law", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "birmingham school of law"}], "id": 2764419442}, {"title": "managing judicial innovation in the european court of human rights", "year": 2015, "source": "human rights law review", "authors": [{"name": "fiona de londras", "affiliation": "birmingham school of law"}, {"name": "kanstantsin dzehtsiarou", "affiliation": "university of surrey"}], "id": 84944781}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
