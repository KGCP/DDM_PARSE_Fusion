Its significance lies in the identification of important tensions in regional politics arising from the legacies of colonialism and the Cold War, the Melanesia/Polynesia divide and the advent of new actors. Outcomes include a deeper understanding of regional processes, and the motives, interests, values and expectations which underpin them, to inform scholarly approaches, policy formulation and public discourses.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140101227", "id": "517944", "institutions": ["Macquarie University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140101227", "researchers": ["Prof Stephanie Lawson"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 159000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:51:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:07:08Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Macquarie University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140101227", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140101227", "DP140101227"], "subjects": ["POLITICAL SCIENCE", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "identity politics", "regional development", "southwest pacific"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517944"}]}]}
