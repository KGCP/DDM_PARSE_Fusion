This project plans to take a historical approach to answering this question. There is a long and rich history of thinking about duties to vulnerable strangers and foreigners, but the contemporary literature on global justice and the &lsquo;responsibility to protect&rsquo; is largely blind to it. The project aims to redress this by producing a history of the idea that states have duties to assist and protect those beyond their borders from mass suffering. It then aims to examine how this history can inform our understanding of present-day debates and dilemmas.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160101679", "id": "663962", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101679", "researchers": ["Dr Luke Glanville"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 90000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101679", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101679", "DP160101679"], "subjects": ["POLITICAL SCIENCE", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663962"}]}]}
