However, the early stages of agriculture may be archaeologically &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; in the tropics due to simple material culture and housing. This project proposes to use the recent evolutionary history of agricultural rodent pests, all of which emerged in situ from among a native rodent fauna, as a proxy for the origins and spread of agriculture, and its subsequent intensification. This project will use phylogeography and population genetics to infer the history of contemporary rodent populations, combined with archaeozoological and ancient DNA analyses of prehistoric samples to test our inferences.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140103650", "id": "517601", "institutions": ["University of Adelaide"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103650", "researchers": ["Prof Stephen Donnellan", "Dr Philip Piper", "Dr Kenneth Aplin"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 465960, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:51:17Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:44Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Adelaide"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103650", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103650", "DP140103650"], "subjects": ["ARCHAEOLOGY", "HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY", "commensal", "neolithic", "rodent"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517601"}]}]}
