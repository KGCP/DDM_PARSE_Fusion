epidemic of hospitalisation of Australians aged 65+ years due to side effects of their medications. Two different groups of medications will be investigated. The first will be the prescribed drugs most often recorded as causes of hospital stay, including those taken to stop blood clotting, for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems, for rheumatism or strong pain relief, anti-cancer drugs and steroids. The study will examine which of these drugs taken under what circumstances has the highest risk, so prevention can be better targeted. The study will investigate if adequate laboratory monitoring of the anti- clotting drugs is taking place and whether the guidelines should be updated. The second group will be 68 medications that should be avoided in seniors according to an international expert panel. The research will see how often these 'inappropriate medications' are still prescribed in the Australian setting, and the size of their contributions to unplanned hospital stays. The researchers suspect that this problem is much larger than immediately apparent from routine statistics, because many of the side effects of inappropriate medications are non-specific, such as confusion, drowsiness or difficulty standing up, thus putting seniors at risk of falls and neglect of other aspects of their health. The study will use a unique and new Australian research facility, which has brought together health data on the entire population of WA from both the State and Commonwealth levels, including information on pharmaceuticals, Medicare use, hospital stays and deaths. The facility works in such a way as to preserve patient and GP privacy. A strong feature of this research will be the degree of involvement of a representative and voluntary group of older Australian patients who attend GP clinics, and the GPs themselves, in advising the researchers on what's important to consumers and GPs.", "title": "Improving Medication Safety in Seniors: A Cross-Jurisdictional Linkage Project", "id": "96729", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403929", "researchers": ["Prof James Semmens", "Ms Diana Rosman", "A/Pr Chris Kelman", "Dr Frank Sanfilippo", "Prof Jon Emery", "Prof Cashel Holman"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 636717.94, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:21Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:46Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Cashel Holman"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403929", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403929", "403929"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "Data linkage", "Health services research", "Safety and quality of health care", "Medication safety", "Older Australians", "Pharmacoepidemiology", "Primary medical care"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96729"}]}, {"description": "Despite 100 years of research there is uncertainty about effects of low dose radiation from background and medical X-rays.

It will also examine the best way that GP visits can promote healthier ageing in all older seniors, aged 75+ years. For each disease and in older seniors, the study will be able to detect which of the following factors are the most important for better patient health: (i) seeing a GP more times, (ii) seeing a GP at more even intervals, (iii) seeing the same GP, or (iv) seeing a GP with a lot of experience in chronic diseases. Separate investigations will be made in older people living in hostels and nursing homes, because their needs may be different. The study will also evaluate the benefits of a major change that occurred to Medicare in 1999, when GPs were paid to perform health assessments and to prepare health plans (with other health workers) for patients with chronic health problems.
