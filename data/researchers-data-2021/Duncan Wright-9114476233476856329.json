This would allow rapid and timely completion of two major projects: the Taipan galaxy survey would be first to test a potential discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe that may signal new physics, while the FunnelWeb stellar survey would (in tandem with two space missions) identify potential nearby exoplanets and trace the history of the Milky Way. The benefits include high scientific impact for the two surveys, international showcasing of the Australian Starbug technology, and a national astronomical survey facility for the next decade.", "title": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities - Grant ID: LE180100009", "id": "1317691", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE180100009", "researchers": ["Prof Matthew Colless", "Dr Elisabete da Cunha", "Dr Dougal Mackey", "Prof Scott Croom", "Prof Christopher Blake", "Dr Edward Taylor", "Prof Michael Drinkwater", "Prof Tamara Davis", "A/Prof Sarah Brough", "Dr Duncan Wright", "Prof Simon Driver", "A/Prof Michael Brown", "Prof Raymond Norris", "Adj/Prof Andrew Hopkins"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 340160, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:13Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:46Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE180100009", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE180100009", "LE180100009"], "subjects": ["ASTRONOMICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1317691"}]}]}
