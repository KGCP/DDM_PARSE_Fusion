ocean surface temperatures can increase beyond the 35 degree centigrade threshold for the survival of humans and many other mammal species. Climate models predict that ocean surface temperatures will exceed 35 degree centigrade in parts of the middle east and throughout much of South East Asia in as little as 50 years. This project will use a series of laboratory experiments to test whether parts of the ocean surface can be warmed beyond this limit under natural conditions. Expected outcomes of this project are a new understanding of what sets the maximum surface temperature of the ocean, thereby allowing us to determine whether coastal regions of the humid tropics and sub-tropics will remain habitable for humans and other mammal species in the near future.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100791", "id": "1378282", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100791", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Roderick", "Dr Callum Shakespeare"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 270000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100791", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100791", "DP190100791"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378282"}]}, {"description": "This Centre aims to transform understanding of past and present climate extremes and revolutionise Australia&rsquo;s capability to predict them into the future.
