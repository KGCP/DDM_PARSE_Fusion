The goal is to obtain delicate estimates for various operators between function spaces, often motivated by the study of partial differential equations, several complex variables, Cauchy-Riemann (CR) geometry and analytic number theory.More precisely, I am interested in sharpening some results of Bourgain and Brezis about embeddings of certain critical Sobolev spaces, and some related cancelling / cocancelling L^1 estimates of Van Schaftingen. I am also developing a pseudodifferential calculus, involving operators of mixed homogeneities, with applications to several complex variables and CR geometry. Furthermore, I am interested in problems from time-frequency analysis, particularly those related to Stein-Wainger type oscillatory integrals. Recently I have been working on Fourier decoupling inequalities and related applications.For publications / preprints, see this page."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [], "ANDS-Grants": []}
