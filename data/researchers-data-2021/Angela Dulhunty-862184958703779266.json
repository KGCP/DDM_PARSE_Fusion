occur in skeletal muscle during development and in myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a significant health issue since it is the most common adult muscular dystrophy, with an occurrence of ~1 in 7000. The results will provide much needed information about the membrane-associated molecular mechanisms that regulate muscle contraction and may provide a basis for drug design and treatment of myotonic dystrophy. Respiration and locomotion depend on the release of calcium ions from stores inside muscle cells. Ryanodine receptor calcium channels regulate calcium release from the stores. The essential nature of ryanodine receptors is underlined by death at or before birth when ryanodine receptor expression is defective. In addition genetic defects in the ryanodine receptor cause cardiac arrhythmias, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. Ryanodine receptor function is compromised in heart failure and fatigue. The essential role of ryanodine receptors makes them a potential therapeutic target, but they are not used in this way because of our limited knowledge of the protein. Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multi-system disorder, in which an expansion of non-coding DNA leads to changes in expression of several different proteins. Although the genetic basis of myotonic dystrophy is now reasonably well understood, the contribution of molecular changes in the affected proteins to the myopathy has not been investigated. Our group has recently discovered that the juvenile form of the ryanodine receptor protein is highly expressed in adults suffering from myotonic dystrophy. By discovering more about the properties of the juvenile isoform, we will understand more about the basic mechanisms of ryanodine receptor function in developing muscle and in myotonic dystrophy and be able to design drugs to specifically modify ryanodine receptor activity.", "title": "Characteristics of splice variants of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor: implications for myotonic dystrophy", "id": "98688", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316937", "researchers": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 258000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:50:00Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:46:09Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316937", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316937", "316937"], "subjects": ["Cell Physiology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY", "calcium release and excitation-contraction coupling", "muscle development", "myotonic dystrophy", "ryanodine receptor calcium release channels", "splice variants of ryanodine receptors", "muscular dystrophies", "neuromuscular diseases"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98688"}]}, {"description": "Controlling the concentration of calcium inside cells is extremely important for normal cell function. For example, a brief increase in calcium concentration inside muscle cells is essential for muscle contraction and the normal heart beat. This calcium is kept stored in sacs inside cells and is rapidly released when needed through calcium channels known as ryanodine receptors. We have discovered that some proteins (glutathione transferases and intracellular chloride channel proteins) inside cells can affect how much calcium flows through these calcium channels. The proteins were thought to have other functions and our discovery of their effect on ryanodine receptor calcium channels has caused considerable excitement. We now plan to explore how they do this. We will mutate specific regions of the proteins to discover which regions are important and which are not. We will also look at whether closely related proteins have similar effects. The new class of ion channel modulator that we are studying has the capacity to alter not only respiration, movement and cardiac contraction, but also other aspects cardiovascular function, neuronal activity and immune responses. Understanding the way in which soluble proteins can interact with ion channels may reveal a novel target for drugs that affect ryanodine receptor calcium channel function and allow the rational design of specific drugs to regulate ion channels or ion channel modulators.", "title": "CLICs and GSTs: New Ion Channel Modulators", "id": "81610", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268027", "researchers": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty", "Prof Philip Board"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 402000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:15Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:09Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Philip Board"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268027", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/268027", "268027"], "subjects": ["270199", "CALCIUM SIGNALLING", "FUNCTION OF CLIC PROTEINS", "FUNCTION OF GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASE", "HEART AND SKELETAL MUSCLE CONTRACTION", "REGULATION OF RYANODINE RECEPTOR CHANNELS", "FATIGUE", "HEART DISEASE", "MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA", "NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE", "VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/81610"}]}, {"description": "This project addresses essential vital life functions such as respiration and movement and factors that determine whether muscles are better suited to weight lifting, endurance or sprint activities.

The results will elucidate molecular mechanisms in muscle contraction and will provide a basis for drug design and treatment of muscle disorders. Respiration and locomotion depend on changes in calcium concentration inside muscle cells. Cardiovascular function, neuronal activity and immune responses also depend on the release of calcium from internal stores. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channels, either alone or in combination with a different internal calcium channel, regulate calcium release in each of these diverse functions. The essential nature of RyRs is underlined by death at or before birth when RyR expression is defective. Genetic defects in the RyR cause cardiac arrhythmias, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. RyR function is compromised in heart failure and fatigue. The key role of RyRs makes them a potential therapeutic target, but they are not used as such because of the limited knowledge of the nature and structure of their regulatory sites. Electrical signals from the brain are able to release calcium from internal stores in muscle and initiate muscle contraction by virtue of a physical interaction between two calcium channel proteins, a surface membrane channel and the RyR. The molecular basis of this protein-protein interaction is is not understood and is a subject of this proposal. We will (a) solve the structure of one part of the surface channel that is known to contribute to the protein-protein interaction with the RyR, (b) determine the amino acid residues that interact with each other and (c) evaluate the functional consequences of the the binding of proteins. Understanding more about RyR regulation will pave the way for rational drug design and the eventual use of the RyR as a therapeutic target.", "title": "STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE II-III LOOP OF THE SKELETAL DHPR AND THE RYANODINE RECEPTOR", "id": "95265", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224235", "researchers": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty", "Prof Philip Board", "A/Pr Marco Casarotto"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 410250, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:37Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["E/Pr Angela Dulhunty"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224235", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224235", "224235"], "subjects": ["320602", "calcium signalling", "excitation-contraction coupling", "ion channel regulation", "protein structure", "protein/protein interactions", "central core disease", "fatigue", "malignant hyperthermia", "muscle weakness", "neuromuscular disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95265"}]}, {"description": "The importance of proteins that regulate calcium stores of heart muscle is graphically illustrated by massive changes in cell structure and function, which lead to ventricular fibrillation and fatality when the proteins are disrupted.
