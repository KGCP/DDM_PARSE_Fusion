In the context of global terrorism and the resurgence of technologically sophisticated authoritarian states, effective intelligence collection and analysis of electronic data is crucial for the national security of liberal democratic states. Yet intelligence agencies in Australia, United States, European Union and so on, are not only under pressure to perform, but must also meet a variety of ethical challenges, notably privacy constraints and democratic accountability. This project will contribute to Australia's national security policy making environment, and to privacy and broader human rights debates, by providing an evidenced based, ethically informed set of practice and policy guidelines for viable national security intelligence practice in liberal democracies.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180103439", "id": "1316974", "institutions": ["Charles Sturt University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103439", "researchers": ["Prof Seumas Miller", "A/Prof Patrick Walsh", "Prof Roger Bradbury", "Dr Adam Henschke"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 277696, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:36Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Charles Sturt University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103439", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103439", "DP180103439"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1316974"}]}]}
