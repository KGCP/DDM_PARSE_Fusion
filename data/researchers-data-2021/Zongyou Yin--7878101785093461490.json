This project will develop novel wireless sustainable nano-reactors, which can be scaled to a system working in an ambient environment for high-yield production. The expected outcomes are to synthesise nano-flowers composed of 2D functional nano-leaves, which will be fabricated into a flexible large-area carbon dioxide-to-solar fuel system. This project will also expand knowledge in heterojunctions, surface chemistry and nano-manufacturing of 2D materials.
