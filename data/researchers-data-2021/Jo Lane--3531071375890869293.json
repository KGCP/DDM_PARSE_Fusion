My PhD research focused on improving face perception and quality of life in age-related macular disease. In my current role as a postdoctoral fellow I am working on the Our Health in Our Hands (OHIOH) Project with a team of researchers across the ANU and people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) to improve personalised care in MS. In this role I collaborate with researchers, ACT Health clinicians and people living with MS to establish MSBase, a Neuro-Immunology Registry, and facilitate the ACT MS Cohort. My research interests include MS-related fatigue, the effects of MS on cognition, and MS networks e.g., social, immune, neuronal and microbial networks and how they interact in MS. The ACT MS Cohort study aims to link people living with MS in the ACT and surrounding regions to participate in the four programs within the OHIOH Project which includes collecting samples and data for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Big Data, Biomaker and Monitoring Devices and Health Experience Team.", "project": ["Our Health in Our Hands (OHIOH) Grand Challenge Project"], "publication":
