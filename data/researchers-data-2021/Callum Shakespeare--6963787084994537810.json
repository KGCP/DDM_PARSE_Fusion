Turbulent mixing is caused by internal waves which transport energy from the ocean boundaries into the interior, where they drive mixing of cold, deep water with warmer water above. This mixing is crucial to the ocean circulation which controls the storage of heat and carbon in the ocean, but is inadequately represented in current climate models. The anticipated outcome of the project is an enhanced, global-ocean model incorporating an accurate description of turbulent mixing. This should provide significant benefits to the Australian community by improving the accuracy of future climate predictions.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE180100087", "id": "1314946", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100087", "researchers": ["Dr Callum Shakespeare"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 328075, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:28Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:08Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100087", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100087", "DE180100087"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1314946"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to investigate whether ocean surface temperatures can increase beyond the 35 degree centigrade threshold for the survival of humans and many other mammal species. Climate models predict that ocean surface temperatures will exceed 35 degree centigrade in parts of the middle east and throughout much of South East Asia in as little as 50 years. This project will use a series of laboratory experiments to test whether parts of the ocean surface can be warmed beyond this limit under natural conditions. Expected outcomes of this project are a new understanding of what sets the maximum surface temperature of the ocean, thereby allowing us to determine whether coastal regions of the humid tropics and sub-tropics will remain habitable for humans and other mammal species in the near future.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100791", "id": "1378282", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100791", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Roderick", "Dr Callum Shakespeare"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 270000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100791", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100791", "DP190100791"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378282"}]}]}
