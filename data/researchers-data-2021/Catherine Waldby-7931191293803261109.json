The need for measures to prevent the spread of HCV is based on the clinical implications of infection combined with its current prevalence and predicted spread within Australia. More than 200,000 Australians are estimated to be living with hepatitis C infection. Around 11,000 new HCV infections per year are estimated to occur across the Australia. HCV is spread through blood to blood exposure. In the absence of effective medical treatment for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) education about modes of transmission presents as the most viable means of containing the spread of the virus. The promotion of blood awareness has been identified as a key strategy for such education as it may ensure greater care on the part of the general community in the prevention of blood exposures. However, the development of a heightened awareness of blood as a source of infection is fraught with social and health implications. A crucial concern for those directly involved in promoting blood awareness is the need to ensure that such a strategy does not contribute to the already existing stigmatisation of those living with HCV or, more generally, promote irrational phobias about blood. Findings of the research will assist in the development of public health education campaigns to prevent the spread of HCV. It will also contribute to education prevention for other blood borne communicable diseases including HIV and other viral hepatitides. Further, it will provide a model of inquiry for developing health promotion programs seeking blood, semen, organ and tissue donation.", "title": "An analysis of \"blood awareness\" for the purposes of Hepatitis C prevention education and health promotion.", "id": "76371", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157128", "researchers": ["Prof Catherine Waldby", "E/Pr Susan Kippax", "Dr Marsha Rosengarten"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 196113.36, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2002, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:21Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:20Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": ["E/Pr Susan Kippax"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157128", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157128", "157128"], "subjects": ["321216", "Blood awareness", "Illness prevention and health education", "Qualitative research", "Blood borne communicable diseases", "HIV", "Hepatitis C", "Injecting drug use"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76371"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop an ethical and regulatory framework for the use of autologous adult stem cell therapies in Australia.
