Excitability and hyperexcitability of neural circuits in the rodent      piriform cortex (NHMRC Project Grant): This project uses patch clamping, calcium imaging and molecular genetic approaches      to study the spread of electrical activity in the piriform cortex (PC) of      mice. The PC is a phylogenetically-ancient cortical region with a much simpler      structure than other sensory cortices. This comparative simplicity means that      it is an ideal system in which to study fundamental questions about normal      and abnormal brain function. Surprisingly, the PC has been little-studied.      Major aims of this project are: 1. To use functional calcium imaging to track      the spread of electrical excitability through identified microcircuits in      different layers of acute slices of the mouse PC following stimulation of      inputs from the olfactory bulb. This is done under both normal and epileptic      conditions. 2. To use a novel transgenic mouse to selectively manipulate electrical      activity in layer II semilunar cells using optogenetic techniques. This is    a collaboration with Sacha Nelson, Brandeis University, USA.", "2. Neural circuits for odour-processing in the rodent piriform cortex      'in vivo' (NHMRC Project Grant):", "This project uses 'blind' and two-photon targeted patch clamping in vivo to      measure the responses of identified neurons in the piriform cortex to odour      application. This work will allow us to examine the functional roles of the      different classes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that we have identified      in slices of the piriform cortex. The project will also use a 'periscope'      method to image changes in intracellular calcium across the full thickness      of the piriform cortex when applying odours to the nose. This should allow      us to study the mechanisms giving rise to beta oscillations in electrical      activity during odour processing. This work is a collaboration with Matthew      Larkum, Charite Medical University, Germany.", "3. Persistent firing in cortical interneurons: Mechanisms and potential anticonvulsant role (NHMRC Project Grant): This project uses whole-cell patch clamping and voltage imaging to study the mechanisms and possible functions of a recently-discovered phenomenon called persistent firing, which is found in some classes of cortical interneurons.\u00a0 Persistent firing is a state of heightened excitability, in which neurons slowly integrate excitatory inputs until eventually (after a few seconds) they start to fire action potentials at a high frequency, even after the initiating excitation is stopped.\u00a0 We hypothesise that persistent firing is an adaptation to counter undesirable cortical hyperexcitability, such as occurs during epileptic seizures.\u00a0 This idea will be tested.\u00a0 The project also involves developing computational models to test our ideas about how persistent firing affects neuronal networks.\u00a0 This work is a collaboration with Mark McDonnell, University of South Australia."], "publication": [{"title": "Sodium and potassium conductances in principal neurons of the mouse piriform cortex: a quantitative description", "year": "2018", "source": "Journal of Physiology, vol. 596, no. 22, pp. 5397-5414pp", "authors": ["Ikeda K", "Suzuki N", "John Bekkers"]}, {"title": "Pre- and postsynaptic activation of GABA-B receptors modulates principal cell excitation in the piriform cortex", "year": "2018", "source": "Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, vol. 12, no. 28, pp. 1-11pp", "authors": ["Gerrard L", "Tantirigama M", "John Bekkers"]}, {"title": "Spontaneous activity in the piriform cortex extends the dynamic range of cortical odor coding", "year": "2017", "source": "PNAS - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 114, no. 9, pp. 2407-2412", "authors": ["Tantirigama M", "Huang H", "John Bekkers"]}, {"title": "Optogenetic Mapping of Intracortical Circuits Originating from Semilunar Cells in the Piriform Cortex", "year": "2015", "source": "Cerebral Cortex, eprint, pp. 1-13.

It is also a major site of many brain diseases, like schizophrenia and epilepsy. An understanding of how the cerebral cortex works would be a remarkable achievement, of immeasurable benefit to human health. How can one go about studying such a complex structure? The strategy taken in this project is to begin by studying one of the simplest regions of the cerebral cortex, the olfactory (or piriform) cortex. The olfactory cortex is an evolutionarily ancient region of cortex, with a simpler architecture than other cortical regions. Its task is to process the sense of smell, a primitive sense that is more elaborated in lower animals than in humans. The broad goal of our research is to understand, by studying the olfactory cortex of rats, how olfactory processing occurs at the level of nerve cells (neurons). We will use a number of powerful techniques - including microelectrode recording and laser microscopy - to measure the electrical properties of individual neurons. We will also study the synaptic connections between neurons, and how these connections change following memory-inducing stimuli. It is hoped that this work will shed light on how the healthy cortex is able to process and store information, and how brain diseases cause these functions to deteriorate.", "title": "Synaptic integration and plasticity in the rat piriform cortex", "id": "97852", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224240", "researchers": ["Prof John Bekkers"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 250500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:32Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof John Bekkers"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224240", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/224240", "224240"], "subjects": ["320702", "cerebral cortex", "sensory cortex", "synaptic plasticity", "synaptic transmission", "basic science", "cortical plasticity", "neurotransmission"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97852"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to understand how electrical activity in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex enables mice to recognise and remember odours.
