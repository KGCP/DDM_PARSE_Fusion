In 2010 he returned to the Hawkesbury Institute, UWS to continue an independent photosynthesis research program focusing on C4 grasses, Eucalypts and Cotton. Currently, he is an ARC DECRA Fellow within the Research School of Biology, ANU. The overarching theme of his research is to improve plant productivity under future climates. This will be achieved by deciphering chloroplast gene regulatory mechanisms critical for engineering chloroplasts. The second theme of his research is to understand the adaptive evolution of Rubisco catalysis to provide the next generation solutions for tailoring CO2 fixation in plants to variable future climate conditions. He also works within the Cotton Industry to translate basic research into future cotton crops to improve overall resource use.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "The role of leaf width and
