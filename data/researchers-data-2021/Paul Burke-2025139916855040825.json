Using econometric methods, the project aims to assess recent reductions in subsidies for fuel and electricity in Indonesia. Energy subsidies have been a large drain on many governments&rsquo; budgets and are often thought to bring perverse effects. The project may provide a blueprint for the design of future reforms in Indonesia and elsewhere, with the goal of addressing serious issues such as air pollution and traffic congestion while avoiding adverse consequences for the poor. The project also aims to assist budget forecasting and guide economic models on the effects of fiscal settings for energy.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE160100750", "id": "663636", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100750", "researchers": ["Dr Paul Burke"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 370000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:32Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100750", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE160100750", "DE160100750"], "subjects": ["APPLIED ECONOMICS", "ECONOMICS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663636"}]}, {"description": "Mobile technologies are ubiquitous in Australia but knowledge about their widespread effective application for school education is patchy.
