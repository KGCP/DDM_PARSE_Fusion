To tackle these areas, we need to understand their causes, how to prevent them, and the best ways of using this information to improve health for all Australians. This project aims to develop six young researchers in five areas of need so that future relevant and responsive research in mental health and ageing is undertaken. In area 1, researchers will learn to develop and test Internet interventions that reduce anxiety, depression and drug use. People with no access to doctors or who wish to remain anonymous can then self-treat using these proven tools. Area 2 provides training so that researchers from different expert areas understand enough of each other's discipline to tackle the process of ageing - to understand how to stay healthy longer and how to avoid dementia. This area requires expertise and collaboration in genetics, biology, psychology, mathematical modelling and imaging (brain scans), to name just a few specialities required. Area 3 provides training in statistical methods. New methods are needed to analyse increasingly complex and large data sets. In Area 4 researchers are trained to conduct research that consumers (people with anxiety and depression) want to see done. Researchers with direct experience of anxiety and depression will be trained to produce high quality research that meets the needs of those who have these disorders. Finally, Area 5 provides training in getting the outcomes of the research understood by those who make decisions about health priorities and budgets. Many of the gaps in capacity we will address have come about by rapid developments in health and communication technologies and by the recognition that research needs to be more relevant and responsible. Because these gaps require the development of sophisticated knowledge, and the development of new techniques, knowledge and processes, long term stable funding is required.", "title": "Translating population based mental health and ageing research into evidence-based prevention and policy", "id": "114877", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020", "researchers": ["Prof Peter Butterworth", "Prof Kaarin Anstey", "Prof Kathleen Griffiths", "Prof Simon Easteal", "Prof Helen Christensen", "Prof Andrew Mackinnon"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 2370357.5, "fundingScheme": "Capacity", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2013, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:28:30Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Helen Christensen"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020", "418020"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "Biological Psychology", "Epidemiology", "Mental Health", "Population and Ecological Genetics", "Preventive Medicine"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/114877"}]}]}
