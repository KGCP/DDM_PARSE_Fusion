enzyme iNOS, and thus production of nitric oxide in key locations, is a central event in how falciparum malaria kills people who become infected with this parasite. This will largely be based on detecting iNOS and nitrotyrosine in tissues from autopsies collected as part of a malaria research programme conducted in Malawi. Laboratory experiments will also be performed. In particular, there is a body of evidence that suggests the following interactions between inflammatory cytokines and salicylate, with important practical ramifications, in children. 1. Salicylate toxicity, like the acute multi-organ form of childhood malaria it mimics, is probably caused by excess systemic iNOS induction. This plausibly includes the metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, seizures, coma and cerebral oedema seen in both conditions. Both are thus logically susceptible to treatment with specific iNOS inhibitors. 2. The same picture would arise in children when smaller doses of salicylate synergise with IFN-g, IL-1b, and perhaps other cytokines induced by malaria as well as by viruses. This gives the first proposed explanation for Reye's syndrome, defining the circumstances in which it occurs, and predicting a rationale for its treatment. Through the parallels seen in different age groups in malaria and aspirin toxicity, it also rationalises the difference in childhood vs adult malaria syndromes. 3. The overall severity and mortality of childhood malaria in East Africa may be worsened, through this cytokine-salicylate synergy, by home treatment with aspirin when children first become ill. 4. A relative absence of salicylate intake by children in various malarial Pacific Islands may contribute to falciparum malaria being a less severe disease there than in East Africa.", "title": "iNOS, paediatric falciparum malaria, and aspirin", "id": "98075", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148902", "researchers": ["Prof Ian Clark"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 410616.8, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:16Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:46Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ian Clark"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148902", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148902", "148902"], "subjects": ["321010", "Reye's syndrome and salicylate toxicity", "hypoxia", "nitric oxide", "pathophysiology of malarial disease", "pro-inflammatory cytokines", "bacterial sepsis", "basis of Reye's syndrome", "basis of disease in falciparum malaria", "metabolic acidosis", "salicylate toxicity"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98075"}]}, {"title": "Digital camera,dual viewer and computer for light microscope", "id": "101241", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1500", "researchers": ["Prof Ian Clark"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 10205, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Infrastructure Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2000, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:54:41Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:57:45Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ian Clark"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1500", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1500", "1500"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/101241"}]}, {"description": "Infection with a virulent influenza virus that the body has never encountered before, particularly H5N1, sends the immune system into overdrive, and causes a massive release of proteins (inflammatory cytokines), known as a cytokine storm, that in and of itself leads to death.
