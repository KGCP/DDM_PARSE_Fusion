She is the co-series editor of Cambridge University Press series Connecting International with Public Law. http://www.cambridge.org/tr/academic/subjects/law/constitutional-and-administrative-law/series/connecting-international-law-public-law.\u00a0 Her book, Australian Citizenship Law\u00a0(Lawbook, 2017) is a revised second edition of her 2002 book, representing much of the spread of her interest in her research on citizenship issues, looking at the disjuncture between the exclusive legal notion and the more inclusive normative understanding of citizenship. In 2002-2003 she was based at Georgetown University Law Center, as a Fulbright Senior Scholar to\u00a0work on\u00a0the status of nationality in an international law context.\u00a0\u00a0 Kim is a graduate of the University of Melbourne and Harvard Law School. Her graduate work at Harvard was supported by the Sir Robert Menzies Scholarship to Harvard, a Fulbright postgraduate award, and a Queen Elizabeth Jubilee Trust award. Kim\u2019s interests also encompass teaching (where she has co-authored a book on Feedback) and the broader field of education, particularly women\u2019s education. She is currently completing a biography of Joan Montgomery OBE, former Principal of Presbyterian Ladies' College Melbourne, and an influential educator. In the practical legal sphere, Kim has made significant contributions to the jurisprudence in citizenship. She was a member of the Independent Committee appointed by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to review the Australian Citizenship Test in 2008 and she has appeared three times in the High Court of Australia on citizenship matters, with her work cited in\u00a0Singh v Commonwealth (2004).For a fuller biography see http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0613b.htm", "project": ["Professor Rubenstein\u00a0was a CI on an ARC Linkage Grant run by Professor Mary Crock through Sydney University called Small Mercies, Big Futures: Enhancing Law, Policy and Practice in the selection, protection and settlement of refugee children and youth.\u00a0Professor Rubenstein's work in that project concentrated on the the relationship between citizenship and children.", "Professor Rubenstein was the Principal CI on the ARC Linkage Grant oral history project\u00a0Trailblazing Women and the Law (see further below).\u00a0Her co-CIs are based at the University of Melbourne\u00a0with a partner investigator at the National Library of Australia.
