He then returned to teaching and research, and was from 2001 until his retirement Head of the School of Humanities within the Faculty of Arts.", "project": ["In May 2100 I published a book, The Concept of Truth, arising from\u00a0my earlier book on truth: Truth and Historicity.\u00a0 I contend that all contemporary theories of  truth are too narrow, because they assume that truth applies only to what is said.\u00a0 Rather, I argue for a novel conception of truth, by  showing how error is implicated in the actions of all living things; and  by analyzing uses of 'true' in non-linguistic contexts.\u00a0 This analysis explains why truth has normative force, and is highly valued.", "In 2015 I had another book published which articulates the metaphysical underpinnings of this conception of truth.\u00a0 It is called The Metaphysics of Emergence.\u00a0 It argues for a processed-based ontology, as an alternative to the prevailing physicalist metaphysics, and explores the logic and identity of processes, and presenrts a taxonomy of natural kinds of process systems.\u00a0 This leads to definitions of action and life, and an examination of human consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0The book concludes with reflection on time, entropy, value, and causation.", "I have a new book entitled Rethinking Anselm's Argument: A vindication of his Proof of the Existence of God published by Brill in July 2018.\u00a0 It offers a new analysis of the tantalizing arguments for the existence of God first promulgated by Anselm of Aosta, Bec, and Canterbury in 1078 in his Proslogion and in his Reply.\u00a0 It demonstrates how he validly deduces from plausible premises that God so truly exists that He could not be thought not to exist. Most commentators, ancient and modern, wrongly located his argument in a passage which is not about God at all. It becomes evident that, consequently, much contemporary criticism is based on misreading and misunderstanding his text. It reconstructs his reasoning through three distinct but logically connected stages. It shows that, even if Anselm\u2019s crucial premises are sceptically interpreted, his conclusions still follow. Properly understood, this argument is not vulnerable to the standard criticisms, including Gaunilo\u2019s \u2018Lost island\u2019 counter-example.", "I am now working on a sequel, which will show that the conclusions of each of the three stages of Anselm's argument in the Proslogion can be validly deduced from the verified fact that something exists contingently.\u00a0 This proves, that contrary to the conventional classification of his argument as an 'ontological' argument, it is fundamentall a cosmological argument."], "publication": [{"title": "That Anselm", "year": "2019", "source": "s God Exists and Gaunilo's Island Does Not'in P Wong, S Bloor, P Hutchings & P Bilimoria (ed.), Considering Religions, Rights and Bioethics: For Max Charlesworth, Springer, Cham, Switzerland, pp. 115-137", "authors": ["Richard Campbell AM"]}, {"title": "Rethinking Anselm", "year": "2018", "source": "s arguments : a vindication of his proof of the existence of GodBrill, Leiden, The Netherlands", "authors": ["Richard Campbell AM"]}, {"title": "The Metaphysics of Emergence", "year": "2015", "source": "Palgrave MacmillanLondon", "authors": ["Richard Campbell AM"]}, {"title": "Review of A.D.
