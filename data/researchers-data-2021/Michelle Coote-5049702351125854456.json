(Hons) in industrial chemistry (1995), followed by a Ph.D. in polymer chemistry (2000). Following postdoctoral work at the University of Durham, UK, she joined the Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University in 2001, initially as a postdoctoral fellow with Professor Leo Radom. She established her own research group in 2004 and has recently completed an ARC Future Fellowship. She has published extensively in the fields of polymer chemistry, radical chemistry and computational quantum chemistry, and is a member of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science. She has received many awards including the 2001 IUPAC prize for young scientists, the RACI Cornforth medal (2000), Rennie medal (2006), David Sangster Polymer Science and Technology Achievement Award (2010) and HG Smith Medal (2016), the Le Fevre Memorial Prize of the Australian Academy of Science (2010), and the Pople medal of the Asia Pacific Association for Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (2015). She was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2014, and is currently an Associate Editor for the Journal of the American Chemical Society.", "project": ["We work in the fast-growing field of computer-aided chemical design. We use state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations to identify and explain the mechanism, kinetics and thermodynamics of complicated multi-step chemical processes - information that is difficult (often impossible) to obtain via experiment alone. We then use this information to design in silico new chemical reagents to improve the efficiency of an existing process or, in some cases, allow new chemical products to be made. We work in close collaboration with many experimental groups (including industry), both nationally and internationally, who put our chemical designs into practice. Our particular area of interest is radical chemistry, and especially radical polymerisation, and we are members of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science.", "Some of our current areas of research include", "-the development and experimental benchmarking of computational methodology for studying larger chemical reactions, including those related to polymerization and enzyme-mediated processes", "-the design of better reagents and better kinetic models for controlling the molecular weight and stereochemistry of radical polymerization,", "-clarifying the mechanism
