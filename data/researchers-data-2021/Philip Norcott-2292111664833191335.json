For example even in very powerful NMR spectrometers, the number of\u00a01H nuclei that contribute to a signal is less than 1 in 10 000 \u2013 the rest of the nuclei cancel each other out to give no signal.However, in a\u00a0hyperpolarised\u00a0sample all nuclei are detected at once, and the NMR signals can be thousands of times stronger than normal, and take only a few seconds to achieve the same signal which would otherwise take hours or even days of experiment time. Ultimately, advances in NMR can be translated to MRI applications, where hyperpolarisation can dramatically reduce scanning times in a clinical setting."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "delivering strong 1h nuclear hyperpolarization levels and long magnetic lifetimes through signal amplification by reversible exchange", "year": 2017, "source": "proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america", "authors": [{"name": "peter j rayner", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "michael j burns", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "alexandra m olaru", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "marianna fekete", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "gary g r green", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "louise a r highton", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "ryan e mewis", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "simon b duckett", "affiliation": "university of york"}], "id": 125754415}, {"title": "an in water on water domino process for synthesis", "year": 2012, "source": "green chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "calan spielman", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "christopher s p mcerlean", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}], "id": 55009144}, {"title": "an in water on water domino process for synthesis", "year": 2012, "source": "cheminform", "authors": [{"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "calan spielman", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "christopher s p mcerlean", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}], "id": 41354064}, {"title": "overview of the synthesis of carbazoloquinone natural products", "year": 2016, "source": "cheminform", "authors": [{"name": "alex norman", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "christopher s p mcerlean", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}], "id": 41354064}, {"title": "overview of the synthesis of carbazoloquinone natural products", "year": 2016, "source": "tetrahedron letters", "authors": [{"name": "alex norman", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "christopher s p mcerlean", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}], "id": 133942674}, {"title": "total synthesis of heliespirone a and heliespirone c", "year": 2014, "source": "european journal of organic chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "christopher s p mcerlean", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}], "id": 21317199}, {"title": "total synthesis of heliespirone a and heliespirone c", "year": 2015, "source": "cheminform", "authors": [{"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}, {"name": "christopher s p mcerlean", "affiliation": "university of sydney"}], "id": 41354064}, {"title": "fine tuning the efficiency of para hydrogen induced hyperpolarization by rational n heterocyclic carbene design", "year": 2018, "source": "nature communications", "authors": [{"name": "peter j rayner", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "kate m appleby", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "wissam iali", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "richard o john", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "sam hart", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "adrian c whitwood", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "simon b duckett", "affiliation": "university of york"}], "id": 64187185}, {"title": "using 2h labelling to improve the nmr detectability of pyridine and its derivatives by sabre", "year": 2018, "source": "magnetic resonance in chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "michael j burns", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "peter j rayner", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "ryan e mewis", "affiliation": "manchester metropolitan university"}, {"name": "ryan e mewis", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "simon b duckett", "affiliation": "university of york"}], "id": 112856106}, {"title": "long lived states to sustain sabre hyperpolarised magnetisation", "year": 2016, "source": "physical chemistry chemical physics", "authors": [{"name": "soumya singha roy", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "peter j rayner", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "philip norcott", "affiliation": "university of york"}, {"name": "gary g r green"}, {"name": "simon b duckett", "affiliation": "university of york"}], "id": 181332294}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
