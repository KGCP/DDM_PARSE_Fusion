It will examine the relationship between women&rsquo;s presence in peacemaking processes, women&rsquo;s rights and gender provisions in peace agreements, and women&rsquo;s participation in post-conflict governance of countries with successful peace agreements. Women&rsquo;s participation in peace processes makes a successful peace agreement likelier, but may not consolidate peace or lead to greater participation by women in the governance of the country. Anticipated outcomes are analysis of the relationship between peace processes and gender equality in conflict-affected societies; improved consular delivery of aid programmes in fragile states; and targeted air delivery that empowers women.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP160100085", "id": "941617", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100085", "researchers": ["Prof Jacqui True", "Dr Nicole George", "Dr Katrina Lee-Koo", "Dr Sara Davies", "Dr Barbara King", "Ms Sally Moyle"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 553000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:55Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:52Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100085", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP160100085", "LP160100085"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/941617"}]}]}
