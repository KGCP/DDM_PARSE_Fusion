A particular research interest is polar (ferroic) behaviour in the solid state and the exploitable physical properties associated with it such as ferroelectricity, pyroelectricity, piezoelectricity and dielectric behaviour. Systems investigated include flexible framework structures, ferroic materials, dielectric materials, modulated structures, piezoceramics, microporous molecular sieve materials, non-stoichiometric solid solutions, solid ionic conductors and functional electroceramics."], "biography": "Ray Withers obtained his Ph.D from the University of Melbourne followed by postdocs at the Universities of Toronto and Bristol. He arrived at the ANU in 1986 and has been Professor of Materials Chemistry in the Research School of Chemistry there since 2004. He formally retired at the end of 2013 and is currently an Emeritus Professor. His research interests lie in the synthesis, structural characterization and crystal chemical understanding of the structures and properties of disordered, aperiodic and functional materials. He is particularly interested in compositionally and/or displacively flexible materials whose structures and properties are finely balanced and hence susceptible to alteration via applied external
