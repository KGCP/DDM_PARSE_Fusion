I'm currently working on  temporal privacy-preserving record linkage techniques (PPRL) for  multiple parties. PPRL is the problem of identifying matching records  from different databases that correspond to the same real-world entities  without compromising privacy of the entities represented by those  records. In my PHD research study I developed scalable techniques for  efficient and effective indexing mechanisms in PPRL for multiple  parties.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Towards a", "year": "2018", "source": "smart' cost-benefit tool: using machine learning to predict the costs of criminal justice policy interventions'Crime Science, vol. 7, no. 12, pp. 1-13", "authors": ["Manning M", "Wong G", "Graham T", "Thilina Ranbaduge"]}, {"title": "Evaluation of Advanced Techniques for Multi-Party Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage on Real-World Health Databases", "year": "2017", "source": "International Population Data Linkage Conference, International Population Data Linkage Network, Swansea University Wales United Kingdom", "authors": ["Thilina Ranbaduge", "Vatsalan D", "Randall S"]}, {"title": "Scalable block scheduling for efficient multi-database record linkage", "year": "2016", "source": "16th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM 2016, ed.
