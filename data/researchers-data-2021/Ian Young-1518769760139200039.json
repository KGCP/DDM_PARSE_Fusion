They appear to be primarily involved in inducible hematopoiesis in response to infections and in the pathogenesis of allergic and inflammatory diseases. In allergic responses, IL-3 and IL-5 play critical roles role in the expansion of basophils and eosinophils respectively. GM-CSF has an important role in macrophage differentiation.Our initial work was on the cloning of mouse IL-3 and human IL-5 and the determination of cytokine gene structure and organization. Subsequently, we used IL-5-deficient mice to study the role of IL-5 and eosinophils in allergic inflammation in asthma and parasite infections and determined the mechanisms regulating IL-5 expression by human and mouse T cells. We next investigated the structural biology of cytokine receptor signalling. The X-ray structure of the human beta common receptor involved in IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF signalling was published in Cell in 2001. We showed that the receptor had a unique structure being an intertwined dimer before activation and that it possesses a novel ligand binding site involving domains 1 and 4 of the respective protein chains of the dimer. More recently, we have identified a second isoform of the IL-3 receptor and are currently characterizing the two modes of IL-3 receptor activation and signalling. We are also studying the role of transcription factors and microRNAs in cytokine-supported differentiation of myeloid progenitors to inflammatory cells and will use the knowledge gained to explore new ways of controlling inflammation in asthma. Overexpression of IL-3Ra occurs in AML and we will investigate if aberrant IL-3 signalling is important in AML pathogenesis.

Being born too early is the major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Data from Australia indicate that each year, more than 17,000 babies will be born prematurely. Of these infants, over 10,000 will suffer respiratory complications and about 1300 will die during the first 21 days of life. The sickest and most premature of these infants require admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in a tertiary hospital. Aside from the medical implications of premature delivery, there is also a considerable fiscal challenge to society. While treatments for the prevention of labour have improved considerably over the past decade, current screening tests of preterm labour (ie Fetal Fibronectin test) are unreliable and have poor positive predictive values. The principal objective of this project is to develop and deliver a multiplex assay for the prediction and diagnosis of human preterm labour. Through the successful application of our own proteomic discovery programmes using both ovine and human cervico-vaginal fluid samples, we have identified several new protein markers of labour. Having completed this Phase 1 biomarker trial and established proof-of-concept, we are now well positioned to initiate a Phase 2 biomarker trial to determine reliable estimates of assay sensitivity and specificity. This project targets the development of a new diagnostic to meet a recognised market gap. Delivery of such a test will create a new market in pregnancy-based clinical diagnostics and significantly impact on improving health care and quality of life for many preterm babies.

Predictions are typically achieved by extrapolating recorded data to predict probable extremes. The uncertainties associated with this approach are very large. This project aims to develop a new approach called &lsquo;large ensemble aggregate&rsquo; analysis, which brings together data from alternative model predictions or alternative measurement locations to expand the effective data and avoid the necessity for statistical extrapolation. This approach may significantly reduce the uncertainty in estimating extreme values. This would reduce the cost of constructing coastal and offshore facilities and decrease the risk of catastrophic failure.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160100738", "id": "663821", "institutions": ["Swinburne University of Technology"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100738", "researchers": ["Prof Ian Young", "Prof Alexander Babanin", "Dr Peter Janssen", "Dr Kevin Ewans"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 452733, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Swinburne University of Technology"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100738", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100738", "DP160100738"], "subjects": ["MARITIME ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663821"}]}]}
