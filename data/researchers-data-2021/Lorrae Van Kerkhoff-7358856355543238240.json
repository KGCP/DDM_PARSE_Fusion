She is particularly interested in the role of science in  governance, decision-and policy-making as it relates to sustainability;  north-south research collaborations; and institutional influences on the  governance of knowledge.

She convenes the Bachelor of Environment and Sustainability degree program, and teaches first, second and third year undergraduates, as well as supervising graduate students. She holds a PhD from ANU and was a post-doctoral fellow at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health from 2003-2008, and spent 2004-5 with Harvard's Center for International Development, supported by a Fulbright Post-doctoral Fellowship and a Land and Water Australia Travelling Fellowship. While there she worked on the concept of knowledge systems for sustainability, and now focuses her research on knowledge governance and its relationship to social-ecological change. Her work brings together concepts from Science and Technology Studies with Sustainability Science. She has published extensively on integrative and transdisciplinary research concepts and methods, and recently on knowledge governance and \u2018future-oriented\u2019 approaches to conservation.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Diversifying knowledge governance for climate adaptation in protected areas in Colombia", "year": "2019", "source": "Environmental Science and Policy, vol. 94, pp. 39-48", "authors": ["Munera Roldan C", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff"]}, {"title": "Expanding the role of social science in conservation through an engagement with philosophy, methodology, and methods", "year": "2019", "source": "Methods in Ecology and Evolution, vol. 10, no. 3, pp. 294-302", "authors": ["Moon K", "Blackman D", "Adams V", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff"]}, {"title": "Co-Producing Sustainability: Reordering the Governance of\r\nScience, Policy, and Practice", "year": "2019", "source": "Annual Review of Environment and Resources, vol. 44, pp. 3.1-3.28", "authors": ["Wyborn C", "Datta A", "Montana J", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff"]}, {"title": "Beyond \"linking knowledge and action\": towards a practice-based approach to transdisciplinary sustainability interventions", "year": "2019", "source": "Policy Studies, vol. 40, no. 5, pp. 534-555", "authors": ["West S", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Wagenaar H"]}, {"title": "Conservation Decision-Making in Palau: An Example of the Parallel Working of Scientific and Traditional Ecological Knowledge", "year": "2019", "source": "Environmental Management (New York), vol. 64, no. 5, pp. 564-579pp", "authors": ["Pilbeam V", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Weir T"]}, {"title": "Understanding citizen perceptions of the Eastern Hills of Bogota: a participatory place-based ecosystem service assessment", "year": "2018", "source": "Urban Ecosystems, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 19-35", "authors": ["Robson E", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Cork S"]}, {"title": "n integrative research framework for enabling transformative adaptation", "year": "2017", "source": "Environmental Science and Policy, vol. 68, pp. 87-96", "authors": ["Colloff M", "Martin-Lopez B", "Lavorel S", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff"]}, {"title": "Understanding socio-cultural dimensions of environmental decision-making: A knowledge governance approach", "year": "2017", "source": "Environmental Science and Policy, vol. 73, pp. 29-37pp", "authors": ["Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Pilbeam V"]}, {"title": "Transforming conservation science and practice for a postnormal world", "year": "2017", "source": "Conservation Biology, vol. 31, no. 5, pp. 1008-1017", "authors": ["Colloff M", "Lavorel S", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff"]}, {"title": "Future oriented conservation: knowledge governance, uncertainty and learning", "year": "2016", "source": "Biodiversity and Conservation, vol. 25, no. 7, pp. 1401-1408pp", "authors": ["Wyborn C", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Dunlop M"]}, {"title": "Serving the public good: Empirical links between governance and research investment in the context of global environmental change", "year": "2016", "source": "Ecological Economics, vol. 125, pp. 101-107", "authors": ["Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Berry H"]}, {"title": "Crafting usable knowledge for sustainable development", "year": "2016", "source": "PNAS - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 113, no. 17, pp. 4570-4578", "authors": ["Clark W", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff", "Lebel L"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2016", "source": "Knowledge systems and RAPID framework for impact assessments", "authors": ["Davila Cisneros F", "Sloan T", "Lorrae Van Kerkhoff"]}, {"title": "Overcoming barriers to knowledge exchange for adaptive resource management;
