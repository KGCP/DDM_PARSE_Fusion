I received my MS and PhD in 2010 and 2012 respectively from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA in the Center for Distributed Robotics Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos. \u00a0Prior to that I was a software design engineer with Microsoft Corporation in the Windows development team for about 5 years. I received my undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Calicut,\u00a0India in 2002. I am from\u00a0a small city\u00a0Cochin in the southern state of Kerala, India.", "project": ["I have broad interests in variety of topics in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. My PhD research was into topics related to machine learning on matrix manifolds and information retrieval in high dimensional structured data via sparse coding techniques. During my postdoc, I got very interested in using probabilistic\u00a0graphical models\u00a0for various problems in computer vision, specifically to human pose estimation.\u00a0I also have significant
