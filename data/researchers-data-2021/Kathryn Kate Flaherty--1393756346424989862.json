What happens when\u00a0imaginative plots touch our present concerns through the embodied experience of performers and audiences? With Shakespeare as an expansive test case, I investigate how plays play on the stage of public culture. \u00a0My book,\u00a0Ours as we play it: Australia plays Shakespeare, examines contemporary Australian performance. Other\u00a0research treats educational applications of Shakespeare since the advent of English curricula at school and university. Recent publications analyse theatrical rivalry, the agency of the touring actress, civic disorder, sectarian tension, and military commemoration through their involvement with Shakespeare in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Australia. One of my current projects is an international and interdisciplinary collaboration called 'Reading Riot through Shakespeare'. In it we aim for an improved understanding of riot by learning more about the affective and performative dynamics it shares with theatre in the long and colourful history of Shakespeare-associated public disturbances. The monograph on which I am currently working is Moving Women: The Touring Actress and the Politics of Modernity."], "biography": "", "project": ["Moving Women: The Touring Actress and the Politics of Modernity", "Actresses were the first class of female workers to travel on a global scale.
