low-cost light-weight applications: This project will establish Australia\ufffds first flexible roll forming facility. The facility will be unique in the world, being specifically designed to roll form the most advanced high strength alloys into complex three-dimensional shapes and investigate their material behaviour under a wide range of loading conditions. This technology represents a step change in commercial processing and has the capacity to form materials with high strength and limited ductility. This will lead to the development of new techniques for the manufacture of new advanced materials including advanced high strength steels, composites, nano structured metals and light metal alloys for automotive and aerospace applications.", "title": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities - Grant ID: LE140100003", "id": "517215", "institutions": ["Deakin University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE140100003", "researchers": ["Prof Peter Hodgson", "Dr Matthias Weiss", "A/Prof Bernard Rolfe", "Prof Jeong Whan Yoon", "Dr Nicole Stanford", "A/Prof Shankar Kalyanasundaram", "A/Prof Paul Compston", "Prof Liangchi Zhang", "Prof Zheng Jiang", "Dr Dongbin Wei", "A/Prof Matthew Dargusch", "Dr Gui Wang", "Dr Robert O'Donnell"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 280000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2014, "dateTimeModified": "2015-08-13T17:19:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:08Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Deakin University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE140100003", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE140100003", "LE140100003"], "subjects": ["MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING", "mechanics", "metals", "sheet metal forming"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517215"}]}]}
