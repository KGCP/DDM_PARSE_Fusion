The expected outcomes from this project will help to identify policies useful in addressing inequalities and enhancing stability within Australia's important trading partner.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180102875", "id": "1316758", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102875", "researchers": ["Prof Xin Meng", "Prof Loren Brandt", "Prof Hongbin Li", "Dr Guochang Zhao"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 408916, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:35Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102875", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102875", "DP180102875"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1316758"}]}, {"description": "China&rsquo;s urbanisation has come to a turning point. The large pool of rural young workers (16-25 years of age), which fed the industrialisation needs of the 1990s and 2000s, has exhausted. Future growth needs to rely on the increase in the length of stay of the existing migrants and the increase in older new migrants. Due to this shift, the institutional restrictions, which deter family migration, become the key challenge. This project examines the cost of the migration restrictions (shortened labour supply and reduced human capital accumulation for the current and next generation migrants: their education, health and pro-social behavior); and the best way to reform the restrictions on family migration and the priority for the reform.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP140100514", "id": "618653", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100514", "researchers": ["Prof Xin Meng", "Prof Robert Gregory", "Prof Richard Freeman", "Prof Xiaolu Wang", "Ms Helena Bordie", "Mr Liangming Lyu"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 710000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100514", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100514", "LP140100514"], "subjects": ["APPLIED ECONOMICS", "ECONOMICS", "MIGRATION; MIGRATION"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618653"}]}]}
