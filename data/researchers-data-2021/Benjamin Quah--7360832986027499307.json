The specificity of this offensive is governed by receptors that can recognise pathogens. To survive an infection the immune system must rapidly expand the number of immune cells that have receptors that recognise, and can therefore specifically combat, the infection. The underlying theory of immunology, the clonal selection theory, states that this expansion is mediated by the proliferation of immune cells selected on the basis of expressing a pathogen specific receptor. We hypothesise that in addition to this proliferation the immune system may also expand the number of immune cells expressing pathogen-specific receptors by transferring these receptors between cells by a means of cell-membrane sharing. Indeed, we have evidence that this does occur both in the test tube and in animals and can function to amplify the number of immune cells that can specifically recognise a pathogen and thereby help with immune response development.
