Combining historical research, ethnography and discourse analysis, the project intends to investigate the local, national and international context behind the veterans' journey of being forgotten and re-remembered in Chinese history. This work will assist governments and others to understand the legacies of the Second World War in China, and the complexity of Chinese nationalism. Potential benefits include reconciliation in this region through the facilitation of a more open discussion on war experiences and commemoration in Asia, intersecting with Australian commemoration practices.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE190100603", "id": "1378036", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100603", "researchers": ["Dr Shuge Wei"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 411000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:32Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:32Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100603", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE190100603", "DE190100603"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378036"}]}]}
