"Paul Burke commenced his career in Alice Springs in 1983 as\u00a0an Aboriginal Legal Aid\u00a0lawyer and Land Council lawyer during which time he worked on several land claims and became friends with Warlpiri people.\u00a0 On moving to Canberra in 1991 he studied anthropology part-time at ANU and ultimately won a scholarship to complete a PhD in anthropology at ANU.\u00a0 Following the award of his doctorate in 2006 he worked as a consultant anthropologist on native title claims in southern Queensland and the Pilbara.\u00a0 In 2008 he won a three year\u00a0Australian Research Council post-doctoral fellowship\u00a0to investigate the cultural implications of Aboriginal people leaving remote areas, using the Warlpiri as a case study.\u00a0 The research on that project commenced in July 2009.", "project": ["Paul Burke is the Chief Investigator for the Australian Research Council Discovery Project 'Indigenous Diaspora: a new direction in the ethnographic study of the migration of

analytically, historically and ethnographically, using the concept of diaspora.\u00a0 Known for their willingness to move onto new locations, the Warlpiri of central Australia are also one of the best documented exemplars of traditional Aboriginal society and represent an ideal case study for this project.\u00a0 Understanding the Warlpiri will shed light on the process of urbanisation among all remote Aboriginal populations.", "In the complex demography of contemporary Warlpiri society different degrees of transience must be distinguished in order to identify those who wish to establish a permanent life outside Warlpiri homelands from those who are simply travelling on some established circuit -- the travelling Warlpiri.\u00a0 Factors such as marriage, permanent employment and housing will obviously be relevant here.\u00a0 But the primary questions for the project will be:", "Timeline:", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Overlapping jural publics: A model for dealing with the",
