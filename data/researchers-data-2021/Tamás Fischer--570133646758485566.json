He completed his PhD studies in 2005 at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, working on the nuclear export of mRNA and its coupling to transcription. Following his PhD, he was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in epigenetics and chromatin biology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI, NIH) in the USA. He returned to Germany in 2010 to establish his own independent research group at the University of Heidelberg Biochemistry Center. He has recently moved his laboratory to Canberra, Australia to join the Department of Genome Sciences at JCSMR.", "project": [""], "publication": [{"title": "Structural basis for 5", "year": "2017", "source": "-ETS recognition by Utp4 at the early stages of ribosome biogenesis'PLOS ONE (Public Library of Science), vol. 12, no. 6, pp. e0178752-e0178752", "authors": ["Calvi\u00c3\u00b1o F", "Kornprobst M", "Schermann G", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "Interaction of the cotranslational Hsp70 Ssb with ribosomal proteins and rRNA depends on its lid domain", "year": "2016", "source": "Nature Communications, vol. 7, no. 13563, pp. 13563-13563", "authors": ["Gumiero A", "Conz C", "Gese G", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "Novel Epigenetic Silencing Pathway Involving the Highly Conserved 5", "year": "2016", "source": "-3  Exoribonuclease Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe'PLoS Genetics, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. e1005873-e1005873", "authors": ["Tucker J", "Ohle C", "Schermann G", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "Transient RNA-DNA Hybrids Are Required for Efficient Double-Strand Break Repair", "year": "2016", "source": "Cell, vol. 167, no. 4, pp. 1001-1013", "authors": ["Ohle C", "Tesorero R", "Schermann G", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "The fission yeast MTREC complex targets CUTs and unspliced pre-mRNAs to the nuclear exosome", "year": "2015", "source": "Nature Communications, vol. 6, no. 7050, pp. 1-11", "authors": ["Zhou Y", "Zhu J", "Schermann G", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "Combinatorial Control of Light Induced Chromatin Remodeling and Gene Activation in Neurospora", "year": "2015", "source": "PLoS Genetics, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. e1005105-e1005105", "authors": ["Sancar C", "Ha N", "Yilmaz R", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "Non-circadian expression masking clock-driven weak transcription rhythms in U2OS Cells", "year": "2014", "source": "PLOS ONE (Public Library of Science), vol. 9, no. 7, pp. e102238-e102238", "authors": ["Hoffmann J", "Symul L", "Shostak A", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "The great repression: Chromatin and cryptic transcription", "year": "2013", "source": "Transcription (Austin), vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 1-5", "authors": ["Henning B", "Tam\u00e1s Fischer"]}, {"title": "Chd1 chromatin remodelers maintain nucleosome organization and repress cryptic transcription", "year": "2012", "source": "EMBO Reports, vol. 13, no. 11, pp. 997 -
