Work on Empire/Imperialism combines a conceptual history in the public domain with a theoretical mapping in the social sciences, with a focus on what changes in our epistemology, methodology, disciplinary framing and understanding of the international system if we take Empire/Imperialism as our category of analysis above state, system or capital. Work on Global Citizenship has a combined theoretical and empirical focus examining both how Global Citizenship has been theorised by scholarship in the Social Sciences and how the concept has been operationalised through Global Education Governance and a variety of elite actors in the international domain. Both projects have wider interdisciplinary implications for International Relations, Political Communication, International Political Sociology, studies of Political Mobilisation through Social Movements and Global Civil Society, and critical perspectives on citizenship, development, global governance and the knowledge economy. April explicitly tries to situate her work in an interdisciplinary frame.Methodologically April is co-convenor of the\u00a0Interpretation Method Critique Research Cluster\u00a0at the Australian National University which has the aim of raising the profile of Interpretivist and Critical methodologies in the social sciences with a specific focus on the politics of knowledge production and undergraduate and graduate student capacity building in this area.\u00a0April is currently accepting supervision of HDR or Honours projects in teh areas of political mobilisation, communication, Global Citizenship, Global Education Governance, any aspect of empire or imperialism."], "biography": "April Biccum, Canadian born, received an MA in Critical theory and Ph.D. in Politics and International Relations from Nottingham University.", "project": ["Global Citizenship Education and the global politics of Truth and Knowledge. \u00a0Includes Global Education Governance, the Knowledge Economy, social capital, state society relations, Global Civil Society and the local politics of inclusion and exclusion.", "A conceptual history of the words 'empire' and 'imperialism' and a mapping of approaches to theorising empire in teh social sciences in the context of the American Empire Debate of the early 20th Century."], "publication": [{"title": "What is an Empire?
