Palaeomagnetic analysis of Earth's ancient magnetic field helps us to derive plate tectonic reconstructions and to use geomagnetic reversals to date rock sequences. These applications depend on statistical methods that are either flawed or that lack sufficient diagnostic power to be useful for addressing increasingly complex questions. Expected outcomes are an urgently needed new generation of palaeomagnetic statistical analysis methods. The project will provide quantitative tools that will benefit all palaeomagnetic applications across Earth Science and have widespread benefit and impact in academic and industrial research.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100874", "id": "1378297", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100874", "researchers": ["Prof Andrew Roberts", "Dr David Heslop", "Dr Janice Scealy"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 360000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100874", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100874", "DP190100874"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378297"}]}, {"description": "The control of epidemics requires cross-sectoral engagement across various fields such as health, government, international law and security, at both national and international levels.
