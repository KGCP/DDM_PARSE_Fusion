I have carried out archaeological research in Indonesia, East Timor, New Guinea, the Bismack Archipelago, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Hawaii.\u00a0 I was appointed Professor of Archaeology in 1997 in what is now the School of Archaeology and Anthropology, College of Arts and Social Sciences at the ANU. Previously I was a Senior Research Fellow in Archaeology and Natural History, in what is now the College of Asia Pacific. Before joining the ANU in 1987, I was an Associate Professor in the Anthropology Department of University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu.
