The focus is on understanding processes of social and environmental change, with a broader aim of developing a better understanding of the interplay between theory and practice. My goal is to join analyses of ecosystems, social systems, and egosystems, to enhance social and environmental sustainability within and across those systems. Consistent with this, increasingly my research has been done in interdisciplinary contexts and appears in interdisciplinary outlets. I believe this helps spread the scientific impact of social psychology, provides novel and important forums in which to do social psychology, and ultimately helps inform and advance the science of social psychology."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Sustainable Consumption: The Psychology of Individual Choice, Identity, and Behavior", "year": "2020", "source": "Journal of Social Issues, vol. 76, no. 1, pp. 1/08/2018", "authors": ["Ruby M", "Iain Walker", "Watkins H"]}, {"title": "Utilising a hospital based setting to increase organ donor registration", "year": "2020", "source": "Transplantation, vol. 104, no. 6", "authors": ["Sutherland M", "Moloney G", "Norton M", "Iain Walker"]}, {"title": "ctivating the legacy motive mitigates intergenerational discounting in the climate game", "year": "2020", "source": "Global Enviromental Change, vol.
