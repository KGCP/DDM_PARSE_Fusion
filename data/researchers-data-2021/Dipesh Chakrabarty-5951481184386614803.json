The burning of coal has released unprecedented quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and exacerbated anthropogenic climate change. This inter-disciplinary project investigates the 'coal rush' in sociopolitical terms, asking how it can be superseded. This project seeks explanations of why new coal mines and coal-fired power stations are constructed, investigate social conflicts centred on new coal facilities, and analyse what social factors may enable transition from coal. Specific sites, national contexts and transnational connections will be compared to develop a nuanced understanding of dependence on coal, and how it may be overcome.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140102606", "id": "517736", "institutions": ["University of Technology, Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140102606", "researchers": ["A/Prof James Goodman", "Prof Linda Connor", "A/Prof Devleena Ghosh", "A/Prof Tom Morton", "Dr Stuart Rosewarne", "Prof Dr Ortwin Renn", "Prof Dipesh Chakrabarty"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 540000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:51:12Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:53Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Technology, Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140102606", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140102606", "DP140102606"], "subjects": ["ANTHROPOLOGY", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "climate change", "development", "india", "germany", "australia"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517736"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to use ethnography to investigate how legitimacy for renewable energy can be won or lost.
