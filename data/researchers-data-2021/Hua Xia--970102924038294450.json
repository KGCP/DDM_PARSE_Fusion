It has been found recently that energy of surface waves can be converted and stored in the horizontal water motion near the surface. This project aims to develop new technologies to harness wave energy, including a novel method of accumulating the energy of random waves into a stationary surface flow and novel methods of manipulating floating objects by sending surface waves. This may help to stop the spread of surface pollutants or attract floating objects by sending waves towards them, and may help us to understand how rip currents are formed on the beach.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160100863", "id": "663843", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100863", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Shats", "Dr Hua Xia", "Dr Horst Punzmann", "Dr Nicolas Francois", "Prof Gregory Falkovich"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 551000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100863", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100863", "DP160100863"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663843"}]}, {"description": "Understanding winds in the lower atmosphere is of great fundamental and practical importance.

It is expected to provide unprecedented measurement capabilities with significant benefit to the design, control and modelling of complex fluid flows found in many areas. Applications include the jets used for heating, cooling, mixing, and drug delivery in engineering and pharmacy to the kinematics of sperm and micro-organisms in bio-medicine, and wave-particle flows in geo-physics.", "title": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities - Grant ID: LE180100166", "id": "1317799", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE180100166", "researchers": ["Prof Julio Soria", "Prof Ivan Marusic", "Prof Michael Shats", "Prof Anthony Lucey", "Prof Moira O'Bryan", "Prof Nicholas Hutchins", "Prof Adrian Neild", "Prof Tilak Chandratilleke", "A/Prof Jason Monty", "A/Prof Ramesh Narayanaswamy", "Dr Hua Xia", "Dr Victor Cadarso Busto", "Dr Jimmy Philip", "Dr Callum Atkinson", "Dr Nicolas Francois"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 637800, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:14Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:46Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE180100166", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE180100166", "LE180100166"], "subjects": ["INTERDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1317799"}]}]}
