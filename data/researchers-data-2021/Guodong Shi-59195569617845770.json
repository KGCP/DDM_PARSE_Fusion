Such systems are operated as network systems with interconnected functioning units (agents) where cooperative and adversarial agent relations often coexist. This project aims to develop the theories and tools for designing and building dynamic networks with signed interactions that arise from a variety of applications where both cooperative and adversarial agent interactions coexist. By developing theories and algorithms for control and identification over such systems, this project will contribute directly to their safe and robust operation. The resulting theories will provide deeper understanding of network control systems and the resulting algorithms will enable the elimination of attackers and malicious users for online review systems and smart grids. This project will contribute to increased cybersecurity for all Australians.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190103615", "id": "1378772", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190103615", "researchers": ["Dr Guodong Shi", "Dr Jochen Trumpf", "Prof Karl Henrik Johansson", "Prof John Baras", "Prof Claudio Altafini"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 495000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:50Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:50Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190103615", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190103615", "DP190103615"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378772"}]}]}
