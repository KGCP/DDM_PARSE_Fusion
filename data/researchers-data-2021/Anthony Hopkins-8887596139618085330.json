In 2018, Anthony received a Vice-Chancellor's citation for outstanding contribution to student learning\u00a0in recognition of his innovative teaching approaches designed to take students as close as possible to the coalface of legal practice. Anthony began his career as a criminal defence lawyer in Alice Springs at the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service. After taking time off to raise\u00a0children, Anthony returned to the law as a lecturer at the University of Canberra,\u00a0before being\u00a0called to the bar in 2010. He continues to practice as a barrister with a focus on sentencing and appellate criminal cases. Anthony's research, and his work in legal policy, is focused on reforms to the criminal justice system that promote equality and\u00a0reduce incarceration. He has a particular focus on the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the criminal justice system. Most\u00a0recently Anthony\u00a0has focused on exploring the links between equality and compassion, where compassion is understood as the foundation that enables turning towards those who are caught in the criminal justice system, and towards actors in that system who are liable to burnout.\u00a0This research\u00a0is supported and influenced by Anthony's continuing mindfulness\u00a0meditation practice.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Set Up to Fail?
