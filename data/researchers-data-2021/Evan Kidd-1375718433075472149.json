investigate the processes of language acquisition to support the development of evidence-based strategies for improving children's early language. Some children learn language earlier and more easily than others. Understanding why this is the case is important because successful acquisition is strongly associated with positive life outcomes such as academic achievement and psychological wellbeing. This project focuses on typically developing children, investigating how their ability to detect frequently occurring patterns in the environment significantly contributes to their acquisition of grammar in early childhood. The project plans to use an innovative triangulation of experimental methods from developmental psychology, longitudinal analysis and cognitive modelling to drive the development of new models of language acquisition and transform our understanding of both typical and atypical acquisition.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160101917", "id": "663988", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101917", "researchers": ["A/Prof Evan Kidd", "A/Prof Joanne Arciuli", "Prof Michael Smithson"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 274000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101917", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160101917", "DP160101917"], "subjects": ["PSYCHOLOGY", "PSYCHOLOGY AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663988"}]}, {"description": "ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language.

What can Australia do to increase its linguistic abilities at a time of increasingly multilingual demands in trade and information?
