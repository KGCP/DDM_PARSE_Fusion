My research has focused on the physiological and pathological role of transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) in the mammalian cortex. TRPs comprise a superfamily of nonselective cation channels that are well preserved throughout evolution and across species. Recently, my research identified high expression of TRP Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in rodent cortical neurons. Currently, I combine in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging, and behavioural assays to investigate how TRPA1 modulates sensory processing in rodent cortex across modalities of whisker-touch and vision.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Localized two-photon photoswitching of Optovin in rat cortical neurons", "year": "2019", "source": "Journal of Physics D:
