Her research focuses on gardens and the history of landscapes, as well as the visual culture of theatre and festivals, and the connections between these two areas. Her research focuses on the visual culture of landscape, the way it is shaped, represented and epxeirneced in the pre-Enlightenment era. Her current research focuses on GIS and visualisation technologies and  their potential for extending art historical research into new areas.  Her main project is Digital Cartographies of the Roman Campagna,  which is operating in collaboration with the British School at Rome.  This project brings together historical maps with modern mapping  technologies to recreate the lost landscape of the Roman Campagna, and  draw together data and research from a variety of disciplines, including  art and architectural history, social history, cultural geography and  the history of climate and ecological change. She has published on the gardens of Lucca, history of emotions and set design, and artistic relationships between Britain and Italy in the eighteenth century. She has run the popular Melbourne Art Network website as editor and webmaster since 2010 and she is a founding editor of the online open-access art history journal emaj (emajartjournal.com). She is currently in charge of Marketing and Communications for the Art Association of Australia and New Zealand (AAANZ). She also has a background in educational research, including the use of new technologies for learning and assessment and worked as a Research Fellow at the Australian Council for Educational Research for several years.", "project": ["Digital Cartographies of the Roman Campagna: art, climate change, ecology and the landscape in crisis 1600-1900.", "With Mitchell Whitelaw and Lisa Beaven", "This project examines the relationship between artistic depictions and imagery of the Roman Campagna (the flat plains of the countryside around Rome more or less coinciding with the modern region of Lazio today) and the place itself, in the context of ecology, climate change, disease and social history from 1600 to 1900. Two historic maps will be amalgamated to form the basis of this digital platform: Giacomo Filippo Ameti\u2019s Il Lazio con le sue conspicue strade antiche (made in 1693) and Battista Cingolani della Pergola\u2019s Topografia Geometria dell\u2019Agro Romano (made in 1704), specifically the editions in the British School at Rome library. The digital map will allow a juxtaposition of the long artistic tradition of painting the Campagna, with the lived experience of that environment. This platform will show how artists represented and responded to the rich historical past of the Campagna on the one hand, and its shifting reality on the other.", "Skullbook", "With Sofia Samper Carro, Catherine Frieman and Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller", "Skullbook is a collaborative project between the School of Archaeology and  Anthropology and the Centre for Digital Humanities Research. at ANU.

Skullbook will produce the first digital bone library in  Australia.
