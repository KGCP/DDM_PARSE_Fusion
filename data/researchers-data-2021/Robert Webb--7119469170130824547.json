Since joining the ANU Climate Change Institute and Fenner School of Environment and Society his primary areas of focus have been climate change adaptation, and sustainable urban development, with projects at the local, regional, national and international levels. These projects have involved synthesis and coordination across government, research and stakeholder interests, taking an integrated systems and trans-disciplinary approach.He is also interested in the broader sustainable development agenda from both the scientific (e.g. earth systems science and planetary boundaries) and policy/practice perspectives (e.g. as co-leader of an Australian Academy of Science/ Future Earth Australia sustainable urban development initiative; pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals; and integration across policy domains)."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "methodology for the assessment of climate change adaptation options for cultural heritage sites", "year": "2020", "source": "Climate, vol. 8, no. 88, pp. 1-21", "authors": ["Carmichael B", "Wilson G", "Namarnyilk I", "Robert Webb"]}, {"title": "Networking urban science, policy and practice for sustainability", "year": "2019", "source": "Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, vol. 39, pp. 114-122", "authors": ["Bai X", "Colbert M", "McPhearson T", "Robert Webb"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2019", "source": "Sustainable cities and regions: 10 year strategy to enable urban systems transformation", "authors": ["O'Donnell T", "Robert Webb", "Dodson J"]}, {"title": "Local and Indigenous management of climate change risks to archaeological sites", "year": "2018", "source": "Mitigation and adaptation strategies for global change, vol. 23, no. 2, pp. 231-255", "authors": ["Carmichael B", "Wilson G", "Namarnyilk I", "Robert Webb"]}, {"title": "Co-designing adaptation decision support: meeting common and differentiated needs", "year": "2018", "source": "Climatic Change, vol. 153, no. 4, pp. 569-585", "authors": ["Robert Webb", "Rissik D", "Petheram L"]}, {"title": "Sustainable urban systems: Co-design and framing for transformation", "year": "2018", "source": "AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment, vol.
