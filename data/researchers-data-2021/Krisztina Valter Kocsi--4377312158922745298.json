My published  work has made an impact in two particular areas: (1) The role of oxygen  levels in the stability and degeneration of photoreceptors; and (2) the  retina's ability to self-protect against stress, using the regulated  expression of protective factors. In the former area I was the first to  demonstrate the oxygen dependence of several forms of photoreceptor  degeneration; in the latter I have shown the sites of trophic factor  binding to organelles of the photoreceptor. These lines of research have  led to the formulation and testable hypotheses concerning the  mechanisms that either damage or protect photoreceptors. Using the  light-induced model of retinal degeneration, I was able to test the  effects of protective factors and investigate their action mechanism on  the stressed retina. To characterise this model further, I started to  investigate the role of mitochondrial damage, metabolic changes and  oxidative damage in light-induced photoreceptor injury.In the  past 5 years I have been working on cell biology-based, non-invasive  therapeutic approaches to manage retinal degenerations. I have been  assessing the effects of light management in collaboration with Prof Jonathan Stone (USYD), photobiomodulation (using near-infrared light irradiation) in collaboration with Prof Janis Eells (University of Milwaukee, US) and dietary saffron in collaboration with Prof Silvia Bisti (University of L'Aquila, Italy) on the progress of retinal photoreceptor damage or death. I tested  these approaches on models of retinal degeneration, with both  environmental and genetic background. I was able to demonstrate that  light management is a relatively simple and cost-effective way to slow  retinal degeneration, at least in some forms of retinal degenerations  (in the P23H-3 model). I also showed that photobiomodulation can slow  degeneration in the developing P23H-3 retina, as well as protect from  light-induced degeneration. Experiments with saffron supplementation  also showed that it is potentially a valuable tool in slowing or  preventing some forms of degenerations. In collaborations with Dr Ulrike Mathesius (RSB, ANU) we are exploring effects of photobiomodulation on protein level changes.In  the past 3 years I have started to look at the role of complement in  the initiation and maintenance of retinal degeneration. In collaboration  with Prof Jan Provis (ANUMS), we are investigating the  events that activate the complement system and could be responsible for  the loss pf photoreceptors leading to blindness in conditions such as  age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Recently, I formed collaboration  with Profs Girish Kotwal (US), Go\u03b4mundur J. Arason (Iceland) and Gudni \u00c0. Alfredsson (Iceland) to investigate the possible beneficial effecto of a novel complement inhibitor in the retina."], "biography": "I received my medical degree (MD) in 1986 in Budapest, Hungary and  became a Fellow of the Association of Hungarian Ophthalmologists in  1990. I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney in 2000 on the role  of the environment in the initiation or progression of retinal  degenerations. Thereafter, I took on a postdoctoral research position in  the Department of Anatomy and Histology at The University of Sydney.  During my years at USYD I have participated in and formed many  scientific collaborations, including a long-standing collaborative  relationship with Prof Silvia Bisti, at the Universit\u00e1 di L'Aquila,  Italy.\u00a0 In early 2003 I left The University of Sydney and took up a  postdoctoral position at the Research School of Biological Sciences at  The ANU. I became a chief investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence  in Vision Science in 2006.  I also received a graduate certificate in  teaching in higher education in 2008 (ANU,CEDAM)", "project": [""], "publication": [{"title": "How Can We Show You, If You Can", "year": "2020", "source": "t See It?
