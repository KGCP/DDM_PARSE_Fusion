Patients will have their hospital stay prolonged during which time they will employ scarce health care resources that might otherwise have been made available to others in need, they will suffer additional pain and anxiety, they will take longer to recuperate after discharge using primary care and outpatient services more intensively and there is a sevenfold increase in the chance of dying in hospital as a result of an infection. There will be other social costs as those affected take longer to return to their normal economic activities. The aggregate economic burdens imposed by healthcare-associated infection in the US are valued at $AU 11.3 Billion and $AU 3.1 in the UK. Research in currently underway to estimate the economic costs to Australia. One type of hospital infection are those that affect the blood and many are caused by invasive devices. At least 3,500 patients are affected each year in the Australia. The human and financial costs of these particular infections are significant. These infections can be prevented but the preventive activities are costly. The purpose of this research is to systematically evaluate the cost and effectiveness of all known infection control interventions to identify those which offer the best value for money. Furthermore we propose to identify the efficient investment in infection control activities, a point where the economic benefit is equalised with economic cost. This research will identify how much to invest in infection control and the specific interventions to which these investments should be directed. Efficient infection control will save lives, improve outcomes for patients, reduce the period of recuperation, and reduce the significant economic costs to both the patient and the health care system.", "title": "The economics of reducing the risk of healthcare-acquired intravascular device related bloodstream infections", "id": "96918", "institutions": ["Queensland University of Technology"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/290505", "researchers": ["Ms Frances Birrell", "Prof Tony Pettitt", "Dr Peter Collignon", "Prof Nicholas Graves", "Prof Michael Whitby", "Prof Diana Battistutta"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 119500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:22Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:44:42Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Queensland University of Technology"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Nicholas Graves"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/290505", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/290505", "290505"], "subjects": ["340204", "cross-infection", "health economics", "hospitals", "policy and interventions", "bacteraemia", "hospital morbidity", "infection control", "infectious disease", "mortality"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96918"}]}]}
