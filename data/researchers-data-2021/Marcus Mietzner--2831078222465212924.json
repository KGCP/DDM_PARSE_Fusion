While much of the recent research on this subject has focused on the personalities of the four post-1998 presidents, this study intends to highlight institutional and structural aspects of the presidency. In particular, the proposed research aims to explore to what extent democratization, decentralization and power diffusion have constrained Indonesian presidents in exercising executive authority. When completed, the project aims to deliver a comprehensive picture of Indonesia&rsquo;s post-authoritarian presidency, describing in detail its constitutional powers, institutional set-up and structural limitations.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150104277", "id": "618206", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150104277", "researchers": ["Dr Marcus Mietzner"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 170768, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:06Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150104277", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150104277", "DP150104277"], "subjects": ["POLITICAL SCIENCE", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "DEMOCRATIZATION; INDONESIA; PRESIDENTIALISM"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618206"}]}]}
