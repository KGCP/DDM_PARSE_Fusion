This \u2018contact\u2019 language has been said to exist from anywhere between the late middle ages until the nineteenth-century. This project will map the various linguistic forms, sources, and places of language which has been termed \u201clingua franca\u201d across the Mediterranean from 1353 to c.1740. It aims to provide a comprehensive database of object, textual and lexical items which can be easily searched for linguistic forms.", "2) Koineization in Renaissance Italy", "The focus of my current project is on the historical formation of \u2018common\u2019 or koine languages, and their interaction with standard languages. In particular, I am interested in how different grammars react to each other and form a common language when different dialects are brought together by processes of (relatively quick) migration. This situation arises often in historical contexts, and is particularly prevalent in late medieval Italy. I am currently writing a volume which investigates these microlevel dynamics in the letters of a nun from fifteenth-century Milan, Margherita Lambertenghi. Using freshly discovered archival materials from the Archivio di Stato in Milan, focus is placed on the role of women\u2019s writing in Renaissance Italy and how a linguistic analysis of this writing can help us understand language change. Margherita\u2019s letters contain evidence of a form of non-literary Milanese that is so far undocumented in the literature and has been understudied. Due to an extreme lack of documents from Milan during the fifteenth century, her writing contains precious insights to the broader forms of language mixing that was part of an ongoing process.", "3) Languages of Renaissance Italy\u00a0(with Dr Alessandra Petrocchi, University of Oxford)", "This unique volume represents the first-ever collection of essays that deal with multiple types of language contact and cross-cultural exchanges in and with respect to Renaissance Italy (1300 to 1600). The contributions span a wide variety of topics, including the development of the Italian language from Latin, early Italian vernaculars, cross-linguistic and cultural exchanges with the Mediterranean regions (thus with Hebrew, Arabic, and Byzantine Greek primary sources) and European countries (Spanish, French, German, Dutch, and Middle English primary sources). The volume employs comparative methods, cross-linguistic research, and investigates interdisciplinary topics. It takes a fresh approach to the history of late medieval and early modern Italy\u00a0by focusing\u00a0on\u00a0East/West\u00a0linguistic and cultural encounters, transmission of ideas and texts,\u00a0multilingualism in literature (various\u00a0genres and various forms of multilingualism),\u00a0translation practices, reception/adaptation, transculturalism and literary exchanges, and the relationship between languages and language varieties. It aims to provide a comprehensive picture of a truly global Renaissance Italy where languages, textual traditions, and systems of knowledge from different geographical areas either combined or clashed.
