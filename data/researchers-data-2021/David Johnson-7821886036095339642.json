In particular we will establish whether the compound erythropoietin (Epo), which occurs naturally in the human body but its human recombinant form can also be used as a treatment, may be useful in protecting cells from death following a shortage of oxygen. . We have already described how Epo can protect the kidney, but no one has yet described its action on kidney cell differentiation or its effect on structural and vascular support in the injured kidney. When might Epo treatment be effective? Could it protect against chronic renal disease? Likewise, whilst more very pre-term babies survive, this is a crucial period when they are at heightened sensitivity to lack of oxygen and they are at risk of brain damage and poor development because of lack of maturation of key structural cells in the brain. The role of Epo in aiding brain cell maturation and on blood vessel formation and function in this faulty development period is not known. Both of these health problems are major issues causing huge costs to society both financial and emotional. Despite the early evidence of a useful role for Epo in human disease treatment, current experimental and clinical data demonstrate the importance of further thorough investigation of mechanisms and cellular pathways that will underpin improvements in clinical outcomes. A particular strength of our project is that by comparing similarities and differences in the kidney and brain, we will be able to elucidate the mechanisms of action of Epo and its analogues.", "title": "Cytoprotection by erythropoietin in hypoxia-ischaemia of the kidney and brain", "id": "97214", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401568", "researchers": ["Prof Paul Colditz", "A/Pr Glenda Gobe", "Prof Michael Goligorsky", "Prof David Johnson"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 477661.4, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:03Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:00Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof David Johnson"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401568", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401568", "401568"], "subjects": ["BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "Molecular biology", "Neonatology", "Nephrology", "Neurology", "Pathology", "Brain pathology", "Drug therapy", "Infant premature", "Ischaemia-reperfusion injury", "Kidney failure"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97214"}]}, {"title": "Manipulation of tubulointerstitial nitric oxide and cytokine", "id": "100256", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142956", "researchers": ["A/Pr Glenda Gobe", "Prof Zoltan Endre", "Dr David Vesey", "Prof David Johnson"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 211527.55, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:09Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:56:51Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof David Johnson"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142956", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142956", "142956"], "subjects": ["321012", "angiotensin II", "nitric oxide", "progressive chronic renal failure", "renal growth factors", "tubulointerstitial scarring", "chronic cyclosporin nephropathy", "diabetic nephropathy", "ischaemic nephrosclerosis", "renal interstitial scarring"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100256"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop topic modelling-based methods for personalised information discovery, navigation and management systems of large-scale online content, targeted at the creative industries (e.g. advertising and design).
