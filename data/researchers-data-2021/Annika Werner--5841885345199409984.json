"This project aims to explain why some radical right-wing populists in Western democracies enter governmental alliances with mainstream parties while others remain isolated. The emergence, spread and electoral success of radical right populists is a problem facing liberal democracy in the twenty-first century. While these parties&rsquo; policies, ideologies and rhetoric are similar, their relationships with mainstream parties are different. By examining explanatory factors that Political Science studies have so far been neglected, this project seeks to explain this variation and explore its implications for coalition theory.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP170103637", "id": "944284", "institutions": ["Griffith University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170103637", "researchers": ["Dr Duncan McDonnell", "Dr Annika Werner"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 195000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:45:05Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Griffith University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170103637", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP170103637", "DP170103637"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/944284"}]}]}
