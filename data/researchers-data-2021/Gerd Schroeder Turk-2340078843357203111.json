After completing his Diploma thesis on statistical physics in 2000, he completed a PhD at the Australia National University in 2005 on geometric frustration in self assembled bicontinuous lipid systems, titled \u2019Skeletons in the Labyrinth\u2019. From 2006-2015, he was employed as a lecturer (Akademischer Rat), senior lecturer (Akademischer Oberrat) and acting professor (Vertretungsprofessor) at the university of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, conducting and directing research into the geometry and physics of spatially complex systems, with a focus on disordered systems, network-like geometries and biophotonic/nanoengineered applications. In 2015 he moved to a senior lecturer position within the  Maths&Stats Department of the School of Engineering and IT at  Murdoch University in Perth. He completed a habilitation degree in 2013. He was awarded the Prize for Excellence in teaching of the FAU in 2010, and the Emmy-Noether Prize in 2014. He is a founding member of the interdisciplinary research group 'Geometry and Physics of spatial random systems', and a visiting fellow of the Australian National University and the University of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg.", "project": ["I refer to my research area as 'materials geometry', that is, the  combination of geometry and the science of biological or synthetic  materials.
