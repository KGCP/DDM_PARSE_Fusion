However, stigmatising attitudes and discrimination towards those receiving welfare benefits may undermine these policy goals: reducing employment opportunities and causing poorer health and wellbeing. Through innovative experimental studies, the project plans to identify ways in which welfare policy can minimise stigma and promote employment.

It is also a study of normal cognitive development, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. PATH involves three cohorts of adults who were aged 20-24, 40-44 and 60-64 at baseline. They are followed up at four yearly intervals. This application seeks funding for Wave 3 of the study, which will allow for 8 years of follow-up of the baseline sample to be conducted. The key aims are to discover the relationships between biological and psychological processes in depression, anxiety, substance abuse and cognitive ageing; to identify the socio-demographic factors contributing to these disorders, and to quantify more fully the range of social and economic consequences of mental illness and cognitive decline. Such consequences include reduced workforce participation, relationship breakdown, family and carer burden, suicide attempts, use of health services and need for social welfare. Wave 3 will also focus on transitions into parenthood, fertility and mental health, menopause, and retirement. Factors in early and mid-adulthood that influence healthy ageing and cognitive decline in late life will be identified. Information is obtained on physical health, health habits , social networks, employment and work stress, lifestyle activities, personality, family structure, physical function and cognitive performance. DNA has also been obtained and a sub-sample of the oldest cohort also participate in a study of brain MRIs. Longitudinal analysis is the only means of distinguishing the causes of disorders and tracking their development within individuals. PATH is unique in its narrow age-group design and breadth of measures, allowing for detailed understanding of the pathways to mental health and illness, and for identification of how to prevent mental illness and dementia.", "title": "A longitudinal study of depression, anxiety, substance use and cognitive change: PATH Through Life Wave 3", "id": "98889", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418039", "researchers": ["Prof Peter Butterworth", "Prof Kaarin Anstey", "Prof Simon Easteal", "Prof Helen Christensen", "Prof Andrew Mackinnon"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 2068954.8, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2010, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:37Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:46:20Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Kaarin Anstey"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418039", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418039", "418039"], "subjects": ["Mental Health", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "Ageing", "Dementia", "Genetic Epidemiology", "Longitudinal Study", "Mental Health", "Anxiety, Depression", "Cognitive Decline", "Early Prediction of Dementia", "Social Determinants of Health"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98889"}]}, {"description": "Mental health problems and cognitive impairment are major causes of disability in Australia. To tackle these areas, we need to understand their causes, how to prevent them, and the best ways of using this information to improve health for all Australians. This project aims to develop six young researchers in five areas of need so that future relevant and responsive research in mental health and ageing is undertaken. In area 1, researchers will learn to develop and test Internet interventions that reduce anxiety, depression and drug use. People with no access to doctors or who wish to remain anonymous can then self-treat using these proven tools. Area 2 provides training so that researchers from different expert areas understand enough of each other's discipline to tackle the process of ageing - to understand how to stay healthy longer and how to avoid dementia. This area requires expertise and collaboration in genetics, biology, psychology, mathematical modelling and imaging (brain scans), to name just a few specialities required. Area 3 provides training in statistical methods. New methods are needed to analyse increasingly complex and large data sets. In Area 4 researchers are trained to conduct research that consumers (people with anxiety and depression) want to see done. Researchers with direct experience of anxiety and depression will be trained to produce high quality research that meets the needs of those who have these disorders. Finally, Area 5 provides training in getting the outcomes of the research understood by those who make decisions about health priorities and budgets. Many of the gaps in capacity we will address have come about by rapid developments in health and communication technologies and by the recognition that research needs to be more relevant and responsible. Because these gaps require the development of sophisticated knowledge, and the development of new techniques, knowledge and processes, long term stable funding is required.", "title": "Translating population based mental health and ageing research into evidence-based prevention and policy", "id": "114877", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020", "researchers": ["Prof Peter Butterworth", "Prof Kaarin Anstey", "Prof Kathleen Griffiths", "Prof Simon Easteal", "Prof Helen Christensen", "Prof Andrew Mackinnon"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 2370357.5, "fundingScheme": "Capacity", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2013, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:36Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:28:30Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Helen Christensen"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020", "418020"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "Biological Psychology", "Epidemiology", "Mental Health", "Population and Ecological Genetics", "Preventive Medicine"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/114877"}]}, {"description": "The transition from alcohol initiation to an alcohol use disorder is a crucial yet under-studied research area.
