Australia. Research also shows that health inequalities persist from generation to generation. This project extends understanding of health inequalities by investigating whether work conditions contribute to health transmission from parents to children. Work conditions vary by class and occupation and have changed markedly over the last decade. They exert a direct effect on parents' health, and influence resources like income, time, energy and attention that parents can invest in their children, thereby influencing children's health and well-being. In this study, we expand models of parent work and child health to include 1) working conditions (rather than employment versus unemployment); 2) collection of data on father's as well as mother's employment; and 3) investigation of the link between working conditions and parental resources as a route by which health inequalities can be transmitted across generations.
