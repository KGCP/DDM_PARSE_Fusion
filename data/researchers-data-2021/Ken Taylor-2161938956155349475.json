He gained significant and influential experience at the City Planning Department Manchester particularly working on\u00a0an open space policy based on\u00a0remnant river valleys and canals with proposls for their reclamation. This sparked an interest in landscape planning and landscape architecture and he shifted to teaching in these fields at the then Manchester Polytechnic.\u00a0In 1975 he took a position of S/L in landscape architecture at the then Canberra CAE (Univ of Canberra) and later was appointed to a\u00a0personal chair in landscape architecture.\u00a0His interests in historic cultural landscapes, their meanings, values and heritage potenial was sparked in the late 1970s working on a study of the historic landscapes of Lanyon and Lambrigg in the ACT for the National Trust. It also drew on his cultural geography first degree and the concept of reading the landscape, During the 1980s and 1990s he developed ideas on cultural landscape theory and practice and associated heriatge values weaving\u00a0them into his teaching and research leading to his being Co-Director of the Cultural Heritage Research Center at the University of Canberra with Professor Colin Pearson. From the late 1980s he has published nationally and internationally with increasing focus on SE Asia and China in the context of changing global perpsectives on cultural heritage mangement and cultural landscapes. He has undertaken work\u00a0with agencies such as UNESCO World Heritage Centre, ICCROM and ICOMOS. From 2006 until late 2017 he was Associate Editor for 'Landscape\u00a0Research' journal.\u00a0He is \u00a0an Associate member of Rutgers University Graduate Faculty\u00a0He joined The ANU in 2003 where he has continued to publish, supervise PhD students and travel regularly to Asia. At Silpakorn University Bangkok he has taught courses in Management of Historic Places and Cultural Landscpes since 2002 on the International Program in Architectural Heritage Management & Tourism and supervises PhD students.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Recognising values of China", "year": "2020", "source": "s scenic and historic interest areas as world heritage cultural landscapes: Lushan case study'International Journal of Heritage Studies, vol. online", "authors": ["Xu Q", "Ken Taylor", "Han F"]}, {"title": "Cultural sustainability and notions of cultural heritage: a review with some reference to an Asian perspective", "year": "2020", "source": "in Fausto O.
