As a complement to the dynamic, active plate boundary research, I also have an interest in understanding the structure of stable continental interiors as they provide the best long-term record of plate tectonic processes."], "biography": "University of British Columbia -\u00a0Postdoctoral Research Associate, Vancouver, British Columbia,\u00a02006-2008", "project": ["Banda Arc Project\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Eastern Indonesia is one of the least well-understood geological domains of our planet, and yet the region provides a truly remarkable location for unraveling some of the major puzzles of plate tectonics. The recent collision of the Australian continent with the active volcanic arc in the Banda region effectively captures the initiation of continental mountain building and the cessation of island arc volcanism, offering a rare glimpse into a set of processes that have shaped Earth\u2019s evolution over geologic time.\u00a0 Since oceanic subduction and subsequent continental collision have occurred in different stages along the Banda arc, we plan to use the region to study and assess the spatio-temporal evolution of this transition using a variety of methods: seismology, geodyanmics, tectonics, low-temperature geochemistry, and geomorphology. \u00a0We have installed 30 broadband seismometers, including the first ever seismometer on\u00a0Timor Leste, across the archipelago of eastern Indonesia (NTT) in 2014. \u00a0 The award is co-funded by the NSF Geophysics and Tectonics Programs, and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) \u2013 Global Venture Fund (GVF) and led by M.S.\u00a0Miller, T.W. Becker, and A.J. West.", "Congested Subduction:\u00a0\u00a0ARC Discovery Project led by L. Moresi, P. Betts, J. Whittaker and M.S.\u00a0Miller. The project addresses the geodynamics of congested subduction zones and their impacts on the convergent margins. \u00a0We are using a combination of 3D geodynamic modelling, plate kinematic reconstruction and geological and geophysical synthesis to determine how congested subduction zones influence plate kinematics, subduction dynamics, and tectonic evolution at orogen and global scales. We aim to deliver a transformation change in understanding the links between congested subduction, mantle flow, trench migration, crustal growth, transitions between stable convergent margin configurations, and deformation in the overriding plates of subduction zones. Determining these relationships is significant because it will provide dynamic context to interpret the geological record of ancient convergent margins, which host a large percentage of Earth's metal resources.", "ICED\u00a0(Imaged Crust Denali Exhumation)\u00a0Project:\u00a0 National Science Foundation (Tectonics and EarthScope programs)\u00a0funded project led by S. Roeske, T. Waldien, J. Benowitz and M.S. Miller. This project entitled \"A four-dimensional view of deformation in the Eastern Alaska Range - Where did the slip on the Denali fault go?\"\u00a0 \u00a0The Denali fault in south-central Alaska ruptured in a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in 2002, one of the largest continental strike-slip (horizontal motion of blocks of rocks past each other) earthquakes ever recorded. The event brought attention to this little-studied but major fault, which crosses the trans-Alaska oil pipeline as well as the two main highways in Alaska. Scientists predicted Denali fault earthquakes to have only strike-slip motion, but instead, the 2002 quake started as a thrust (putting one block of rock over another) earthquake and uplifted rocks in the Alaska Range along a previously unknown thrust fault. The unexpected earthquake uplift pattern provided the scientific community additional evidence that thrust faults can siphon lateral motion from the strike-slip Denali fault. If these types of fault interactions persist for millions of years, then determining the amount of thrust faulting next to the Denali fault could help solve a long- lived controversy of how much total displacement has taken place across the Denali fault and explain why the Denali fault is surrounded by large mountains on all sides (forming the Alaska Range). Unraveling the history of thrust faulting and uplift next to the Denali fault will not only help us chip away at these intriguing scientific questions but will also inform us on how significant these faults have been in the past and where the greatest seismic hazards in the Alaska Range are today."], "publication": [{"title": "Mapping Earth", "year": "2020", "source": "s deepest secrets'Science,
