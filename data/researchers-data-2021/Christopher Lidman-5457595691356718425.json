Direct measurements of central black hole masses only exist for about 40 relatively nearby galaxies. The unique time-lapse observations and five-year baseline of the Australian Dark Energy Survey will enable us to measure masses for about 400 black holes, an order of magnitude more than previously possible. In addition to weighing black holes, recent results show that with precision measurement these systems may provide a standard candle, a new fundamental yardstick for cosmology. Unlike supernova observations that discovered dark energy, our measurements are practical to distances stretching back across 90&nbsp;per cent of the observable universe.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160100930", "id": "663853", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100930", "researchers": ["Prof Tamara Davis", "Dr Robert Sharp", "A/Prof Paul Martini", "Dr Christopher Lidman"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 360900, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:34Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100930", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160100930", "DP160100930"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/663853"}]}, {"description": "Present-day galaxies look either red and round or blue and disc-like; this project will study galaxies that existed when the universe was one quarter its present age to understand how these different structures came about.

With this improvement in technology it will be possible to do this on much fainter objects than is currently possible using this new wave-front sensor.
