This will be achieved by expanding the evidence base for clinical interventions, particularly patient-centred outcomes, informing professionals who deliver eye-care of the evidence base and increasing access to care. The Centre will increase the evidence base by expanding the Australian Corneal Graft Registry, establishing other national registries, and by conducting clinical trials. It will increase access to care by establishing new models of eye care delivery for common eye problems in urban and remote populations and by developing efficient and cost-effective pathways to care which utilise a wide range of eye-care professionals.", "title": "CCRE in Ophthalmology Outcomes Research", "id": "94641", "institutions": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264620", "researchers": ["Prof Jamie Craig", "Prof Keryn Williams", "Bradley Kirkwood", "Susan Wearne", "E/Pr Douglas Coster", "Prof Konrad Pesudovs"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 2000000, "fundingScheme": "Centre for Research Excellence", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:48:10Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:12Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Konrad Pesudovs"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264620", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264620", "264620"], "subjects": ["OPTOMETRY AND OPHTHALMOLOGY", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "Outcome", "evidence base", "optics", "patient-centred measurement", "registry"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94641"}]}]}
