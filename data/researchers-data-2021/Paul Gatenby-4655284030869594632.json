My interests range from collaborative studies examining the immunopathogenesis of these conditions through to clinical trials of new agents in these conditions. I am also interested in natural history over time of these conditions.Medical Education: My interests lie in development of organisations to deliver medical and health science education and the intersection between organisations who see their role in education as primary, those who regard research as primary and those engaged primarily in clinical service delivery. In many countries these are increasingly combined in Academic Medical Centres. This concept unfortunately appears to be floundering in Australia.Religious Fundamentalism and Medical Ethics: From my practice of medicine as a physician and teaching medical students I have become aware of a growing clash between canonical medical ethics and the fundamentalist religious beliefs of a small number of recent graduates. This is of particular concern in the area of denial of legal services because of religion based conscientious objection."], "biography": "I graduated from the University of Tasmania in 1971 and have worked largely in academic medical centres for most of my career. After an internship at the Royal Hobart Hospital I moved to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital adjacent to the University of Sydney and commenced training in internal medicine. I completed this in Immunology and Immunopathology in 1979 with Fellowships from both the RACP and RCPA. From 1976-1979 I worked in the laboratory of\u00a0 Anthony Basten at the University of Sydney and obtained a PhD. My thesis title: \u201cImmunology and Immunotherapy of Murine Sarcomas\u201d. I never worked with mice again. My post-doctoral years were at Stanford University in the laboratory of Edgar Engleman where I worked on human immunoregulation. I was supported by the NHMRC applied health science fellowship. I returned to a faculty position at RPAH and the University of Sydney and worked on the immunogenetics and immunopathology of systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE, scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis. Much of this work was done in collaboration with Sue Serjeantson from the JCSMR. I also worked in AIDS as I was responsible for the development of an HIV service at RPAH. During these years, the 1980s and early 1990s I combined clinical service, teaching and research. In 1988 I spent a sabbatical in Cambridge, England in the laboratory of Peter Lachmann. In 1994 I came to Canberra for the University of Sydney as foundation Associate Dean of the Canberra Clinical School. In 2002 I was appointed foundation Dean of the ANU Medical School, a position I held until 2008. From the point of view of research these were pretty empty years, although in 2007\u00a0I had another sabbatical in Cambridge working with David Jayne and Ken Smith, particularly on ANCA associated vasculitis. From 2008 until 2012 \u00a0I was Director of Research in ACT Health, responsible for research governance within ACT Health. Since 2013 I have been an Emeritus Professor at ANU.", "project": ["My current interests are in systemic vasculitis and SLE.

The total health system costs of asthma are estimated to be in excess of $600 million (2). Recently, feather pillows have been shown to have more than five times less house dust mite allergen than other pillows. To date, several population-based studies have shown that children using feather upper bedding are also reported by their parents to have less severe wheeze. These findings call into question the National Asthma Council recommendation that people with asthma who are allergic to house dust mite should use synthetic quilts rather than feather or down (3). However, concerns remain that these important findings may only have occurred because unmeasured factors, such as the socioeconomic status or child diet may be closely related to feather bedding use, and in themselves, protective against asthma. Alternatively, parents of a child with asthma symptoms may be more likely to have chosen non-feather bedding. The best way to address these concerns is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether the use of new feather upper bedding is associated with reduced asthma severity among house dust mite-sensitised children with severe asthma. This study is underway and has support in 2001-2002 from the Financial Markets Foundation for Children.
