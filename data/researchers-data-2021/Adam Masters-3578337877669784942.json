His public sector career included time at the Department of Defence, the Australian Taxation Office and 18 years with the Australian Federal Police. While at the AFP, Adam spent close to a decade as team leader with Interpol Canberra and two years teaching counter-terrorism investigations at the AFP College. In mid-2009, Adam changed direction to pursue an academic career and, since 2010, he has worked with the ANU Transnational Research Institute on Corruption (TRIC). Dr Masters' current research and teaching focuses on corruption and anti-corruption, particularly in rich countries, transnational organized crime and the influence of culture on international organisations.", "project": ["Adam has two current research projects. The first - union corruption - explores alternatives to controlling corruption in the union movement using non-traditional (i.e. legal or political) means of addressing the issue. Union corruption in Australia persists despite numerous Royal Commissions, political will and legislative changes in recent decades. Alternatives under consideration include codes of conduct and other internally generated governance mechanisms.", "His second project - Intergenerational organised crime - explores multi-generational criminal activity within families. The question motivating this research is whether family-based organised crime groups are \u2018going legit\u2019.", "Previously, Dr Masters contributed research for two significant projects commissioned by anti-corruption agencies in Australia. The first was his contribution to the report commissioned by the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission. Chapter two of the report Perception of Corruption in Victoria dealt with the manner in which the media reported on corruption. In this chapter, media perceptions were contrasted with the narrower legal definition provided by the IBAC Act.In 2015, Adam was lead author on the report for the Western Australia Corruption and Crime Commission's Project to review corruption prevention theory and practice: Towards a new model for the Corruption and Crime Commission. The report provided the Commission with a conceptual model of corruption prevention grounded in theory and practice."], "publication": [{"title": "Quality of Governance: Values and Violations", "year": "2020", "source": "Palgrave MacmillanCham, Switzerland", "authors": ["Huberts L", "Adam Masters", "Paanakker H", "eds"]}, {"title": "Reviewing Quality of Governance: New Perspectives and Future Research", "year": "2020", "source": "in H Paanakker, A Masters, L Huberts (ed.), Quality of Governance: Values and Violations, Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, Switzerland, pp. 237-247", "authors": ["Adam Masters", "Paanakker H", "Huberts L"]}, {"title": "Quality of Governance: Values and Violations", "year": "2020", "source": "in Dieter Plehwe, Quinn Slobodian, Philip Mirowski (ed.), Nine Lives of Neoliberalism, Verso Books, London, United Kingdom, pp. 3-24", "authors": ["Paanakker H", "Adam Masters", "Huberts L"]}, {"title": "Robustness and the Governance Sin of Bureaucratic Animosity", "year": "2020", "source": "in H Paanakker, A Masters, L Huberts (ed.), Quality of Governance: Values and Violations, Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, Switzerland, pp. 215-234", "authors": ["Adam Masters"]}, {"title": "Corruption in Australia and New Zealand", "year": "2020", "source": "in M Powell, D Wafa, T A Mau (ed.), Corruption in a Global Context: Restoring Public Trust, Integrity and Accountability, Routledge, United Kingdom, pp. 155-176", "authors": ["Adam Masters", "Hall K"]}, {"title": "Tax Havens and Grand Corruption", "year": "2019", "source": "in Philip L Reichel (ed.), Global Crime: An Encyclopedia of Cyber Theft, Weapon Sales, and Other Illegal Activities, ABC-Clio Inc, Santa Barbara, USA, pp. 547-549", "authors": ["Adam Masters"]}, {"title": "Sport Corruption and Match Fixing", "year": "2019", "source": "in Philip L Reichel (ed.), Global Crime: An Encyclopedia of Cyber Theft, Weapon Sales, and Other Illegal Activities, ABC-Clio Inc, Santa Barbara, USA, pp. 535-539", "authors": ["Adam Masters"]}, {"title": "Where is the love?
