Auger electrons have a short range and a strong ability to break chemical bonds. However no measurements of the number of Auger electrons per nuclear decay exist in the critical low energy regime. Calculated Auger yields are incomplete and inconsistent. Building on unique Australian expertise and instrumentation, and performing both calculations and measurements, his project aims to determine the number of Auger electrons per nuclear decay accurately for medical isotopes. The outcome will be accurate dose data for radioisotopes, plus essential knowledge to develop new cancer treatments based on Auger electrons, which target a fraction of a cell.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140103317", "id": "517643", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103317", "researchers": ["Prof Andrew Stuchbery", "Dr Tibor Kibedi", "Dr Maarten Vos", "A/Prof Heiko Timmers", "Dr Filip Kondev"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 453000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:49:49Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:06:46Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103317", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140103317", "DP140103317"], "subjects": ["ATOMIC, MOLECULAR, NUCLEAR, PARTICLE AND PLASMA PHYSICS", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES", "auger electrons", "medical radioisotopes", "nuclear decay"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/517643"}]}]}
