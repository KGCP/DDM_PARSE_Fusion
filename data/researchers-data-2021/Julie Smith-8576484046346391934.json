new markets in human milk assist the economic valuation of breastfeeding. Mothers are finding new ways to share their milk, and milk banking and human milk-based products are emerging as alternatives to commercial infant formula. This research builds on previous world-leading Australian research on the economics of breastfeeding to increase understanding of markets in milk for infants, and inform regulation of milk markets and milk exchange. It will investigate key features of these markets in mothers&rsquo; milk, how milk is priced, and how to access data on market prices which might improve the social and economic valuation of breastfeeding.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT140101260", "id": "618437", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140101260", "researchers": ["Dr Julie Smith"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 702375, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:55Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140101260", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140101260", "FT140101260"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "BREASTFEEDING; GENDER; NATIONAL ACCOUNTING"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618437"}]}, {"description": "Tobacco smoking remains the most common preventable cause of death and illness in Australia today.
