Epigenetic mechanisms control our genome and  ensure that every cell expresses a certain set of genes that defines  its cell type specificity. Epigenetic control of the genome has to be  dynamic and rigid at the same time, to ensure that the cell maintains  its function but can adapt to developmental or environmental changes.  The flaws in these finely tuned epigenetic mechanisms can be very  detrimental and lead to disease states including cancer.Our research is focused on study of epigenetic control of normal  developmental processes, using spermatogenesis (the development and  differentiation of male germ cells) as an excellent differentiation  model system. On the other hand, we study how epigenetic deregulation is  involved in cancer development, examining germ-cell specific epigenetic  regulators, that are aberrantly overexpressed in cancer.Majority of our research is focused around an epigenetic regulator  that was discovered in our laboratory, the histone variant H2A.B, that  is testis and brain-specific. This histone variant is targeted to the  transcription start sites (TSSs) to co-ordinately activates  transcription by a chromatin \u2018opening\u2019 mechanism. More recently, we  showed that H2A.B can directly bind RNA and is involved in pre-mRNA  splicing. This was a major paradigm shift because it showed for the  first time that a histone could not only interact directly with DNA but  also with RNA. To study H2A.B function, we generated a H2A.B KO mouse  model and showed that downregulation of H2A.B affects male fertility and  brain function. The unique ability of H2A.B histone to interact with  DNA and RNA as well as the RNA processing machinery, opens up a whole  new field of research that will provide new insights into the epigenetic  regulation.The Cancer and Germ Cell Epigenetics Group closely collaborates with  The Chromatin and Translational Regulation group, led by Prof  Tremethick. We have a number of current and potential projects that aim  to uncover previously unreported mechanisms of epigenetic control  coordinated by H2A.B. See JCSMR student projects for details."], "biography": "Dr Tatiana (Tanya) Soboleva received her undergraduate training in biochemistry at the Moscow State University. In 1998 she was awarded an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship by the Australian Government.\u00a0 She undertook her PhD study at the JCSMR, ANU, with Dr. Rohan Baker and was awarded a PhD in Molecular Medicine for her work investigating nucleocytoplasmic transport of the de-ubiquitilating enzyme, Usp4. In 2003 she undertook post-doctoral studies\u00a0 with Prof. Ian Young (JCSMR, ANU), investigating how the cytokines activate their receptor systems. In 2006 she joined Prof. David Tremethick\u2019s laboratory (JCSMR, ANU). Together with Prof. Tremethick, she discovered a novel histone variant, which is involved in the activation of genes expressed during specific stages of spermatogenesis. Since 2012, Dr Soboleva established a subgroup in Prof. Tremethick's laboratory and an independent group in 2019. Our collaborative work is based on undertsadning of functions of spermatogenesis-specific epigenetic factors as well as their role when they become upregulated in various cancers.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Gene editing of the multi-copy H2A.B gene and its importance for fertility 06 Biological Sciences 0604 Genetics Jin-Soo Kim", "year": "2019", "source": "Genome Biology, vol. 20, no. 1, pp. -", "authors": ["Anuar N", "Kurscheid S", "Field M", "Tatiana (Tanya) Soboleva"]}, {"title": "RChIP-Seq: Chromatin-Associated RNA Sequencing in Developmentally Staged Mouse Testes", "year": "2018", "source": "in Guillermo A.
