The successful development of cost-effective energy storage technologies is expected to dramatically increase the deployability of CSP systems and this, in turn, will greatly enhance our capacity to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The outcomes of the project are planned to be used towards the development of a commercially viable solar thermal energy storage system. The project also plans to conduct fundamental research into the development of new high-temperature metal hydrides suitable for energy storage in CSP systems.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP150100730", "id": "625942", "institutions": ["Curtin University of Technology"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100730", "researchers": ["Prof Craig Buckley", "Prof Tilak Chandratilleke", "Dr Drew Sheppard", "Dr Ian Davies", "Mr Kenneth Allen"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 570000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Curtin University of Technology"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100730", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100730", "LP150100730"], "subjects": ["MATERIALS ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/625942"}]}]}
