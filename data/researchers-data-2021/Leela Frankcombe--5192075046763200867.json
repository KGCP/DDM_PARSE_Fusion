Climate variations on time scales of years, decades and longer affect Australia, with potentially devastating effects on agriculture, water supply, bushfires and health. Improved climate prediction on decadal time scales is urgently needed, but limited understanding of the system&rsquo;s natural variability hampers progress. This knowledge will reduce uncertainty in near term climate projections, allowing more informed decision making about adaptation on the regional scale, particularly for sectors such as agriculture, health, water and ecosystem management (including bushfire control).", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE170100367", "id": "942481", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100367", "researchers": ["Dr Leela Frankcombe"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 342924, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:56Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100367", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170100367", "DE170100367"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/942481"}]}]}
