To date, I have completed four major ARC/NSF funded field projects, three on the behavioural ecology and conservation biology of birds (White-winged Choughs, 1985-1997, Eclectus Parrots, 1997-2007, waterfowl movements in northern Australia, 2007-2010) and the other on mammals (Serengeti lions, 1990-1995). I have also contributed to a variety of published collaborations on over 40 vertebrate species. Increasingly, I am directing my research at the landscape level as I seek to identify the broad-scale processes shaping conservation problems. The bird species I choose to work with are often large and wide-ranging, and make excellent tools for investigations of habitat use over large areas. I am also actively developing a broad\u00a0research program on the conservation biology of parrots, the bird order with the highest proportion of endangered species. I find this research particularly stimulating because it combines my strong background in behavioural and evolutionary ecology with my more recent passion for conservation biology.The ANU\u2019s Fenner School is unique in Australia for its broad inter-disciplinary approach to environmental problems and creates many opportunities for exciting, novel perspectives that might not be possible in purely disciplinary departments. My research program takes advantage of the proximity of researchers across diverse disciplinary perspectives including, anthropology, ecology, paleobiology, and environmental history to explore the conservation issues faced by our unique wildlife. An example of the success of this approach was our book \u201cBoom and Bust: Bird Stories for a Dry Country\u201d (Robin, Heinsohn, Joseph, 2009, CSIRO Press) which explored the adaptations of Australian birds to erratic weather across historic, pre-historic and geological time frames. It won Australia\u2019s most prestigious award for zoological publications, the 2009 Whitley Medal (Royal Zoological Society, NSW) for its landmark contribution to zoological knowledge.For further details of the activities of my group see\u00a0http://robheinsohn.comCurrent major research projects:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The endangered swift parrot as a model for managing small migratory birds (ARC Linkage Project 2012-15) This project aims to adapt cutting-edge technologies for aerial-tracking of small migratory birds across vast landscapes, and provide multi-scale insights into the conservation needs of endangered swift parrots. Conservation of migratory species requires knowledge of the species\u2019 ecology at multiple sites and the links between phases of the migratory cycle. Austral (within southern hemisphere) migrants such as swift parrots can be challenging to conserve because variable climatic conditions cause great plasticity in their movements. Knowledge of habitat requirements, reproductive success, and mortality, including disease prevalence and return rates from migration, will enable optimal conservation strategies and effective land management.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolutonary and conservation implications of extreme predation on \u00a0female endangered swift parrots (ARC Discovery Project 2014-2016)3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation biology of endangered swift parrots and regent honeyeaters (Ravensworth Mine Offset grant 2014-2018)4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The impact of climate change on inter-specific interactions(ARC Discovery Project with Drs Langmore (lead CI), Kilner, and Lacy 2011-16) An investigation of the phenological mismatch hypothesis for interactions between cuckoos, their hosts and their prey in south-eastern AustraliaAmongst wildlife, the most commonly documented response to climate change involves alterations of species phenologies. For example, many species show an advance in the timing of breeding with increasing temperatures. However, phenological shifts are often unequal across different trophic levels and between different life history strategies, which can result in phenological mismatches between closely interacting species, such as predators and prey or parasites and hosts. We aim to test the phenological mismatch hypothesis for interactions between cuckoos, their hosts and their prey in south-eastern Australia.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tool use and conservation biology of palm cockatoos(Hermon Slade Foundation grant with Dr Langmore 2012-14 )Palm cockatoos are charismatic and emblematic of northern Australia yet our research suggests they are in steep decline. We aim to study the demography and dynamics of the meta-population on Cape York Peninsula and to find the cause of their decline. Palm cockatoos are possibly the only non-human species that manufacture and use a sound tool. They make drumsticks by breaking off a branch, stripping the foliage and trimming to appropriate length. They then grasp the drumstick in their foot and beat it against a hollow trunk. Our project also aims to explore the evolution of complex cognition through analysis of tool manufacture in palm cockatoos."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Modelling dispersal in a large parrot: a comparison of landscape resistance models with population genetics and vocal dialect patterns", "year": "2020", "source": "Landscape Ecology, vol. 35, pp. 129-144", "authors": ["Keighley M", "Langmore N", "Penalba J", "Robert Heinsohn"]}, {"title": "Sustained and delayed noisy miner suppression at an avian hotspot [IN PRESS]", "year": "2020", "source": "Austral Ecology", "authors": ["Crates R", "Rayner L", "Webb M", "Robert Heinsohn"]}, {"title": "Photosensitive automated doors to exclude small nocturnal predators from nest boxes", "year": "2019", "source": "Animal Conservation, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 297-301", "authors": ["Stojanovic D", "Eyles S", "Cook H", "Robert Heinsohn"]}, {"title": "Genomic impact of severe population decline in a nomadic songbird", "year": "2019", "source": "PLOS ONE (Public Library of Science), vol. 14, no. 10, pp. 1-19pp", "authors": ["Crates R", "Olah G", "Adamski M", "Robert Heinsohn"]}, {"title": "n empirical and mechanistic explanation of abundance-occupancy relationships for a critically endangered nomadic migrant", "year": "2019", "source": "The American Naturalist, vol. 193, no. 1, pp. 59-69", "authors": ["Webb M", "Robert Heinsohn", "Sutherland W"]}, {"title": "Genomic population structure aligns with vocal dialects in Palm Cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus); evidence for refugial late-Quaternary distribution?", "year": "2019", "source": "Emu -
