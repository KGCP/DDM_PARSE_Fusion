In particular, I have devoted myself to research on (1) investigating the underlying mechanisms involved in the maintenance of Social Anxiety Disorder by targeting biased information processes (e.g., negative self-imagery and interpretation bias) and their impacts on intervention techniques (e.g., video feedback); (2) examining the effects of intervention/prevention programs for excessive worry (e.g., using Behavioural Activation and Emotion Regulation approaches) in both adults and children; and (3) cross-cultural comparisons of the symptoms of social anxiety (disorder)."], "biography":
