His recent research has focused on Indigenous youth and new media, learning, philanthropy and Indigenous land and resource management as an avenue for the educational and social re-engagement of Indigenous youth in remote regions."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "space to learn: A community-based approach to meaningful adult learning and literacy in remote Indigenous Australia", "year": "2017", "source": "Prospects, vol. online, pp. 13pp", "authors": ["Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab", "Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab"]}, {"title": "Land, Learning and Identity: toward a deeper understanding of Indigenous Learning on Country", "year": "2015", "source": "UNESCO Observatory Multi-Disciplinary Journal in the Arts, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 1-16", "authors": ["Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab", "Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2015", "source": "Business-Related Studies and Indigenous Australian Students", "authors": ["Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab", "Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab", "Robert G (Jerry)  Schwab"]}, {"title": "You are boss for me!\" A case study of the erosion of Indigenous self-determination in education", "year": "2013", "source": "in R.
