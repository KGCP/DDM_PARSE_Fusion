Prisons contain large numbers of women from Indigenous backgrounds, women with a mental illness, women with violent partners and women with substance abuse problems. As such they constitute one of the most disadvantaged groups within Australian society and their children are unlikely to experience a healthy start to life. At any one time around 5-10% of women inside Australian prisons are pregnant. There has been no Australian research into the effect incarceration has upon pregnant women or their babies. Some believe that women who are incarcerated during their pregnancy may have better outcomes as they are outside their normal milieu with restricted access to alcohol and illicit drugs and separated from abusive partners. Others argue that the stress of incarceration and separation from family and friends could result in poorer pregnancy outcomes. This study will investigate whether being imprisoned while pregnant results in better or worse pregnancy and birth outcomes for Australian women and their babies.", "title": "Investigating the association between incarceration while pregnant and maternal and infant outcomes", "id": "76857", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/457515", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Levy", "Prof Elizabeth Sullivan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 307500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:55:20Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T03:42:34Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Michael Levy"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/457515", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/457515", "457515"], "subjects": ["Epidemiology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "data mining", "pregnancy", "prison population", "social determinants of health", "birth", "low birth weight", "pregnancy outcome", "socioeconomic factors"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76857"}]}, {"description": "Prisoner populations are characterised by poor health status including infectious diseases, injury, risk taking behaviours (eg. smoking and self-harm), mental illness, and substance abuse. Serosurveys of blood borne viruses such as hepatitis C and hepatitis B conducted in Australian and overseas prison settings have found that over one third of inmates have been exposed to these viruses with higher rates detected in injecting drug users and female inmates. Few attempts have been made to examine the causes of mortality among prisoners following release from detention. Most interest has focused on overdoses in the period immediately following release; the aim of this study will examine all causes of death among individuals exposed to the correctional environment and compare these to death rates for NSW. Correctional centres house a largely male (94% in NSW) population with backgrounds of disadvantage in all areas, including Indigenous Australians, people of lower socio-economic status, those with a mental illness, and the intellectually disabled. There are currently over 21,000 (June 2001) prisoners detained in Australian correctional centres with approximately 39% housed in NSW. Fifteen percent of the NSW prisoners are Indigenous but comprise only 2% of the general population. The aims of this project will be to: (1) Identify all causes of death among ex-prisoners in NSW for the period 1985 to 2001; (2). Compare death rates in the study group with those in the NSW community; (3) Correlate pre-release health information contained in medical records with specific causes of death; (4) Compare causes of mortality among various sub-groups eg. injecting drug users, the mentally ill, violent offenders, and the intellectually disabled; (5) Examine causes of mortality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous inmates; and (6) use this information to develop pre-release programmes aimed at reducing excess mortality among this group.", "title": "An examination of the causes of mortality following imprisonment in New South Wales using data-linkage.", "id": "94866", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222849", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Levy", "Mr Alan Brnabic", "Prof Tony Butler", "Prof Matthew Law"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 205500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:23Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Tony Butler"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222849", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222849", "222849"], "subjects": ["321202", "electronic record linkage", "indigenous Australian", "intravenous drug user", "mortality", "prison population", "indigenous health", "population-based record linkage"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94866"}]}, {"title": "H1N1 Surveillance for H1N1 influenza 09 and evaluation of the impact of control measures in prisoner populations", "id": "82757", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/585533", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Levy", "Kamalini Lokuge", "Dr Charles Guest", "Leslee Roberts", "Dr Raymond Lovett", "Dr Jill Guthrie", "Prof Paul Kelly", "Prof Geoffry Mercer"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 59940.3, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2009, "endDate": 2012, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-17T04:49:44Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:50Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Kamalini Lokuge"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/585533", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/585533", "585533"], "subjects": ["320402", "H1N1"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82757"}]}, {"description": "Australia has the highest Indigenous incarceration rate in the OECD which impacts profoundly on Indigenous communities.
