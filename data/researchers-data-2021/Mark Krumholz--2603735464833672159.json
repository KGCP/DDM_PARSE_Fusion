The history of these elements, and how they came to be in planets like ours, is one of the most basic questions remaining in astrophysics. The expected outcome is to provide a model for the history of the elements that can both stand on its own and provide a theoretical basis and a set of statistical tools to interpret the flood of data that will arrive from Australian and international telescopes over the next five years. The project will provide deeper insight into the history of the chemical elements that make up stars and our planet. It will also leverage Australia&rsquo;s significant investment in observational excellence and hardware and enhance Australia&rsquo;s leadership in astronomy.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT180100375", "id": "1344015", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100375", "researchers": ["Prof Mark Krumholz"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 978125, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-02T04:21:12Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100375", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT180100375", "FT180100375"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1344015"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to solve the enduring question about galaxy formation of why galaxies are so inefficient at turning gas into stars. This project will investigate two possible agents for this inefficiency, the pressures exerted by starlight photons and the relativistic cosmic rays produced by supernovae, using a combination of numerical simulations, basic physical analysis, and comparison to observations. The expected outcome will be a greatly improved understanding of the physics of the interaction of radiation and cosmic rays with star-forming interstellar gas. This will help complete the picture of how galaxies like our own came to be, and will provide tools for both future simulations and the interpretation of observations.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190101258", "id": "1378366", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101258", "researchers": ["Prof Mark Krumholz", "Dr Roland Crocker", "A/Prof Todd Thompson"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 430000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:46Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101258", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190101258", "DP190101258"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378366"}]}]}
