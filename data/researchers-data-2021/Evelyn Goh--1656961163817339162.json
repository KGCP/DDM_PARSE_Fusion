The project expects to generate new comparative knowledge about development logics and competing sectoral interests around major infrastructure projects that breaks new conceptual ground on analysing international influence and the economic-security nexus in Asia. Enhanced understanding of the conditions under which China&rsquo;s development model is attractive to others, would benefit Australian and international agencies seeking strategic diplomatic and investment decisions in the Asia-Pacific.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP190100755", "id": "1378277", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100755", "researchers": ["Prof Evelyn Goh"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 252000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2019, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2019-06-03T03:28:45Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100755", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP190100755", "DP190100755"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1378277"}]}]}
