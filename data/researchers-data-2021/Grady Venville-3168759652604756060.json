Following pilot studies that affirmed that young students could understand the basic physics that underpins our current best understanding of space, time, matter and radiation, we plan to find out whether it is feasible to teach all students the physics that underpins modern technology. We expect that by introducing students to the paradigm of Einsteinian physics before they learn the useful Newtonian approximations, we will improve their engagement and understanding of physics. This is critical to Australia as enrolments in the hard sciences plummet.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP140100694", "id": "618699", "institutions": ["University of Western Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100694", "researchers": ["Prof David Blair", "Prof Grady Venville", "Prof Nancy Longnecker", "A/Prof Marjan Zadnik", "Prof David Treagust", "Prof Gary Partington", "Prof Dr Francis Chun", "Dr Brian Hewitt", "Mr Neil Jarvis"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 400000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:48Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Western Australia"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100694", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP140100694", "LP140100694"], "subjects": ["CURRICULUM AND PEDAGOGY", "EDUCATION", "INDIGENOUS EDUCATION; INDIGENOUS EDUCATION; PHYSICS EDUCATION; PHYSICS EDUCATION; TEACHING EINSTEINIAN PHYSICS; TEACHING EINSTEINIAN PHYSICS; TEACHING EINSTEINIAN PHYSICS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618699"}]}]}
