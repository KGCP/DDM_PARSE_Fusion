They will be published on-line in October 2020 to mark John Evelyn\u2019s birth in 1620. The coincidences of Evelyn\u2019s time and ours extend beyond the need for trees. Just as the Royal Society published John Evelyn\u2019s Sylva or a Discourse on Forest Trees in 1664, England was hit by the Plague. Just as we were planning a conference forest restoration, we have been hit by COVID19. Just as Evelyn was appalled by waste and deforestation, so are we in many of our landscapes. Evelyn wrote Sylva as a textbook on restoring the English forests. We need to restore our Southern Hemisphere forests and landscapes in ways that consider our own history, environment, changing climate and ravaging bushfires.", "Environment in everyday life", "I am currently investigating the paradoxes of how the environment appears in a variety of aspects of everyday life.
