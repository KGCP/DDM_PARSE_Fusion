are substantial risks of inadequate pain assessment and management in persons with cognitive impairment and particularly in those with communication problems. Undetected or under-treated pain can have serious adverse effects on frail older adults including poorer cognitive performance, increased levels of depression, anxiety and disruptive behaviours, a reduced quality of life and higher levels of functional disability. These adverse effects contribute to greater demands for daily nursing care and a corresponding increase in health care costs. The present proposal aims to develop more sensitive, reliable and valid questionnaire and non-verbal measures of pain in older adults with cognitive impairment and particularly in those with verbal communication problems. By completion, the present studies should provide much needed information on the reliability and validity of several different types of verbal and non-verbal indicators of possible pain. This research should lead to improved pain assessment and management for the growing segment of the population who suffer from pain and impaired cognitive function.", "title": "New methods of pain assessment in demented older persons", "id": "95187", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/285103", "researchers": ["Prof David Ames", "Prof Stephen Gibson", "A/Pr Benny Katz"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 306000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:56:21Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:35Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stephen Gibson"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/285103", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/285103", "285103"], "subjects": ["321211", "cognitive impairment", "diagnostic techniques", "pain assessment", "psychometric testing", "residential care", "acute versus chronic pain", "dementia", "measurement issues", "non-verbal measures"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95187"}]}, {"description": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain significantly impacts on productivity and quality of life and represents one-tenth of health expenditure.

The project plans to examine the long-standing problem of vinylidene-acetylene isomerisation in order to verify the long-suspected existence of large amplitude vibrational motion in small molecules, which are thought to be the signatures of a particular class of chemical dynamics.
