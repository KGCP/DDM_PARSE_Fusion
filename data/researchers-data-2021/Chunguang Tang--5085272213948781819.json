corrosion and wear resistance. However, they suffer from poor ductility and the inability to strain harden, which restricts their range of applications. A recent novel approach of embedding ductile shape-memory-alloy particles into the glassy matrix is a promising way to improve ductility. The project aims to identify the optimal structures of these particles and the corresponding process for improving the properties of copper-zirconium based metallic glasses. This project is expected to create ductile metallic glass composites attractive for engineering, medical, sporting, and military applications.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE150100738", "id": "617499", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE150100738", "researchers": ["Dr Chunguang Tang"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 368000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE150100738", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE150100738", "DE150100738"], "subjects": ["MATERIALS ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING", "COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE; METALLIC GLASSES; METALS AND ALLOYS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617499"}]}]}
