The central themes that drive my research are the following:Relational knowledge making: by collaborating with stakeholders, community, industry and fellow creatives, new knowledge emerges through relation to site, ideas, materials, processes and each other. Real space and time materials-based enquiry has a vital part to play in addressing the epistemological repercussions of how we map, model and make as part of a hybrid digital/analogue culture. The accessibility of complexity: my research crafts language and communication across disciplines, abilities and knowledges. This includes community engagement, professional development for educators and working with children through to traditional academic outcomes such as conference papers and publications."], "biography": "", "project": ["PEDAGOGY:", "2019|\u00a0 Thinking in Space Workshop, At the Heart: Inspiration, Bravery, Compassion and Connection, National Visual Arts Education Conference 2019 National Gallery of Australia", "2016&2015| Making Connections: Divergent Thinking in the Classroom, Program for Educators co-devised and co-presented with Inbar Niv at Heide Museum of Modern Art", "2014| Visiting Artist, Cornish College, Melbourne", "2012| Heide Keepsake with Lucy Irvine, an education video and downloadable resource made with the Education team\u00a0 at Heide Museum of Modern Art.\u00a0 https://vimeo.com/69659105", "", "COMMUNITY:", "2018| Wayforming, 3-week community collaboration, Belconnen Arts Centre as part of Design Canberra", "2017| Place Patterns,\u00a0 6-week community knitting project hosted by Tuggeranong Arts Centre", "2010 | Light, Space, Place, 12-week Bush Fire Recovery Project, Flowerdale Primary School, VIC", "", "PUBLIC COMMISSIONS", "2018| Embark, $160,000 permanent public art commission designed and fabricated in collaboration with Geoff Farquhar-Still for Woollahra City Council in Lyne Park, Rose Bay Sydney", "2017|Index, $80,000 permanent public art commission, Moorabbin Campus, Holmesglen Institute of TAFE,", "2017| Surface Strategies, temporary installation presented by Design Canberra Festival, Canberra Airport", "", "COLLECTIONS", "Central Museum of Textiles, Lodz, Poland", "National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne", "Ararat Regional Art Gallery, Ararat, VIC", "Tamworth Regional Gallery, Tamworth, NSW", "Woollahra City Council, Sydney", "Holmesglen Institute of TAFE, Melbourne", "", "SOLO EXHIBITIONS", "2018| Made of Holes, Belconnen Arts Centre, presented by Design Canberra Festival", "2018| Little Systems, Cox Architecture, Canberra", "2018| Made of Holes, Incinerator Gallery, Melbourne", "2016| Made of Holes, presented by Clarence City Council and Dark Mofo, Rosny Barn, Hobart", "2014| New Works, Foyer Gallery, ANU", "2012| Mapless, Ararat Regional Art Gallery", "2010| Folly and Reverie, Jenny Port, Melbourne", "", "GROUP EXHIBITION", "2017| Enmeshed: Woven Artworks from the Ararat Regional Art Gallery Collection, \u00a0Horsham Regional Art Gallery, VIC", "2017| Public Aspirations: Small Sculptures/Big Ideas, Onespace, Brisbane", "2017| Making Design Research, ANU School of Art and Design Gallery", "2016|Strung, Artisan Gallery, Queensland Craft and Design Centre, Brisbane a survey of fibre techniques from Papa New Guinea and indigenous and non-indigenous Australia.", "2016| 15th International Triennial of Tapestry, Central Museum of Textiles, Lodz, Poland", "2016| 39TH Alice Prize, Alice Springs Art Foundation, NT", "2015| \u2026a piece of string\u2026Brenda May Gallery, Sydney, textile related practices curated by Dr Al Munro", "2015| Finalist in the Tapestry Design Prize for Architects, Australian Tapestry Workshop, Melbourne and Stylecraft, Sydney, as part of a collaborative team with Architect, Robyn Creagh and Graphic designer, Mark Robertson", "2013| Melbourne Now, National Gallery of Victoria", "2013|Wangaratta Contemporary Textile Award, Wangaratta Art Gallery, VIC", "2013|Recent Acquisitions, Ararat Regional Art Gallery, VIC", "2011- 2013| Sensorial Loop, 1st Tamworth Textile Triennial, touring nine galleries across NSW, VIC and QLD, curated by Dr Patrick Snelling, former Head of RMIT Textiles.", "2011| Wangaratta Textile Award, Wangaratta Art Gallery, VIC", "2009|Tradition and Beyond, Broken Hill Regional Art Gallery, contemporary basketry curated by Virginia Kaiser", "2006| Common Goods, Commonwealth Games Festival, Melbourne Museum", ""], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [], "ANDS-Grants": []}
