She is Australia\u2019s leading authority on cervical cancer  control in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Her research  program focuses on cervical cancer control (screening and vaccination)  for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. She is Chief  investigator on the Centre for Research Excellence on Targeted  Approaches To Improve Cancer Services (TACTICS) for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Australians where so co-leads the Prevention and  Screening stream and  Principle Investigator on an ARC Discovery Indigenous grant focused on  understanding the modifiable factors that influence uptake and  completion of HPV vaccination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  adolescents.\u00a0 She brings research experience working with Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander people, creating meaning ways of engagement and  community empowerment within an Indigenist research approach to direct  her program. She has special interests in achieving equity by process  and outcomes in epidemiology, vaccine preventable disease and  translation of research into policy and practice.", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "abstract b4 supportive care needs survey for australian indigenous cancer patients", "year": 2010, "source": "cancer epidemiology biomarkers & prevention", "authors": [{"name": "patricia c valery", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}, {"name": "vanessa l beesley", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}, {"name": "catherine jacka", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}, {"name": "monika janda", "affiliation": "queensland university of technology"}, {"name": "lisa whop", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}, {"name": "peter orourke", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}, {"name": "adele c green", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}, {"name": "gail garvey", "affiliation": "qimr berghofer medical research institute"}], "id": 8391440}], "ANDS-Grants": [{"description": "This program of research will aim to reduce cervical cancer incidence for Indigenous women by developing and trialling health systems interventions to increase cervical screening participation and HPV vaccination coverage.
