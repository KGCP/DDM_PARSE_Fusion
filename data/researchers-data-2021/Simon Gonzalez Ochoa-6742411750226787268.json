After finishing my PhD in English Phonology (Australian English) at the University of Newcastle, and working as a Research Assistant at Griffith University analysing West Australian English (ARC-funded, led by Gerard Docherty), my experience is mainly on Australian English. I develop computational tools (scripts and online apps) for more efficient and practical analysis/visualisation of phonetic and phonological phenomena.", "project": ["Sydney Speaks; Language Variation and change in a diverse society", "Chief Investigator: Catherine Travis, Australian National University", "Funded by: ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language", "url:\u00a0http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/sydney-speaks/", "", "TAP: Transcription Acceleration Project", "Chief Investigators: Nick Evan, Australian National University", "Janet Wiles, University of Queensland", "Funded by: ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language", ""], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "recursive forced alignment a test on a minority language", "year": 2018, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "simon gonzalez ochoa"}, {"name": "catherine e travis"}, {"name": "james grama"}, {"name": "danielle barth"}, {"name": "sunkulp ananthanarayan", "affiliation": "university of texas at austin"}]}, {"title": "initiation progression and conditioning of the short front vowel shift in australia", "year": 2019, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "james grama"}, {"name": "catherine e travis"}, {"name": "simon gonzalez ochoa"}]}, {"title": "using forced alignment for sociophonetic research on a minority language", "year": 2020, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "danielle barth"}, {"name": "james grama"}, {"name": "simon gonzalez ochoa"}, {"name": "catherine e travis"}]}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
