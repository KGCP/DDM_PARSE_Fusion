In order for B cells to accomplish this task, they require help from a specialised popualtion of T cells, which are another type of immune cell - these are known as follicular T helper (TFH) cells. Under normal circumstances, T cells and B cells specifically interact with one another within lymphoid tissues such as tonsils, spleens and lymph nodes - here, they engage in a dialogue, the end result of which is the B cells being instructed to produce the appropriate type of antibodies by T cells. However, if tis process is not regulated, the T cells can deliver too little of too much help - this can result in several different types of diseases of the immune system, such as immunodeficiencies (ie insufficient production of antibodies, resulting in individuals becoming susceptible to infections) or autoimmunity (ie production of inappropriate types of antibodies that can recognise cells of the host, resulting in tissue damage and organ failure). The means by which TFH cells instruct B cells to produce antibodies is not completely understood. This project will seek to determine the mechanism whereby TFH cells carry out this important function by performing detailed examination of them follwoing their removal from tissues such as human tonsils and spleens. In doing so, we hope to design approaches that will allow the function of TFH cells to be improved in cases of immunodeficiencies, or suppressed in situations of autoimmune diseases.", "title": "Follicular T helper cells: critical regulators of humoral immune responses", "id": "99153", "institutions": ["Garvan Institute of Medical Research"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/427619", "researchers": ["A/Pr David Fulcher", "Prof Stuart Tangye"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 272591.72, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:53:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:55:58Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Garvan Institute of Medical Research"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stuart Tangye"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/427619", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/427619", "427619"], "subjects": ["Cellular Immunology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "IMMUNOLOGY", "T-cell/B-cell interations", "autoimmunity", "cellular immunology", "effector CD4 T cells", "immunodeficiency", "X-linked liymphoproliferative disease", "humoral immunity", "immune regulation", "systemic lupus erythematosus"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/99153"}]}, {"description": "It is feasible to sequence patient genomes but we need to know more about how genetic variants cause complex disease.
