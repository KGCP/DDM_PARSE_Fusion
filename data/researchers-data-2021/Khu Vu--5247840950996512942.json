"ANDS-Grants": [{"description": "This project intends to develop mid-infrared spectroscopy as a powerful diagnostic tool. Mid-infrared spectroscopy allows a light beam to determine the chemical composition of objects or gaseous samples. It has wide applicability &mdash; in fields such as medicine, agriculture, the environment, national security and industrial process control &mdash; but its use has been hampered by the lack of bright, low-cost sources and integrated devices. This project aims to implement new Australian-made sources that exceed the brightness of even synchrotrons at modest prices. It also aims to demonstrate a single chip integrated version of such a source as the first step towards deployment of mid-infrared technology.", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP150100914", "id": "625981", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100914", "researchers": ["A/Prof Steve Madden", "Dr Paul Perry", "Prof Barry Luther-Davies", "Dr Mark Junker", "Dr Duk-Yong Choi", "Mr David Death", "Dr Khu Vu", "Dr Xin Gai", "Asst Prof Thomas Mueller"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 285000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100914", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP150100914", "LP150100914"], "subjects": ["ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING", "ENGINEERING"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/625981"}]}]}
