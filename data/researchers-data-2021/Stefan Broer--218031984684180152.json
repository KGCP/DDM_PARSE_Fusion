In 1993 he was appointed as Junior Lecturer at the  University of Tuebingen in the Institute of Physiological Chemistry. In  1998 Stefan was promoted to Senior Lecturer and moved to the Institute  of Physiology at the University of Tuebingen. In 2000 Stefan moved to  the ANU as a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biochemistry and Molecular  Biology. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006 and to full  Professor in 2008.

This study focuses on the mechanisms by which astrocytes supply neurons with precursors for the formation of signalling molecules (neurotransmitters) released from neurons in the transmission of nerve impulses. It will establish how these processes are controlled and also try to develop inhibitors that interfere with this process . The project tries to elucidate whether astrocytes actively regulate neuronal functions by regulating precursor supply.

Once released at the synapse - the contact site between nerve cells - neurotransmitters propagate signals to neighbouring neurons. To allow fast and accurate signal processing in the brain neurotransmitters must be removed rapidly from the site of action. This resets the signal transduction process so that the next nerve impuls can be transmitted. Removal of neurotransmitters is accomplished by transporters, which capture the neurotransmitters and bring them back into neurons and astrocytes, the two major cell types in the brain. Malfunction of these transporters can cause mood disorders, Parkinsons's disease and may play a role in the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders. In this project we try to identify novel neurotransmitters transporters, which are likely to play an important role in neurotransmission. Previously, these transporters were assigned as orphan transporters to indicate our lack of understanding.

The most abundant neurotransmitter is glutamate, which mediates most of the communication in the brain. Following release, this neurotransmitter must be rapidly recycled to prevent levels being depleted and neurotransmission failing. The subject of this grant is to understand what molecules and pathways are used to recycle glutamate in the brain, and how its supply is controlled to sustain continual brain activation.", "title": "Dynamic trafficking of amino acid transporters at synapses and their role in regulating neurotransmission", "id": "1346470", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1105857", "researchers": ["A/Pr Brian Billups", "Prof Stefan Broer"], "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 421219, "fundingScheme": "Project Grants", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": null, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T04:23:25Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-10-03T01:49:45Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Brian Billups"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1105857", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1105857", "GNT1105857"], "subjects": ["Basic Science", "synapse | transporters | glutamine | glial cells | glutamate metabolism"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1346470"}]}, {"description": "Diabetes develops when islet beta-cells fail to secrete insulin. While major differences exist in the mechanisms by which type 1 and type 2 diabetes develop, there is overlap in beta-cell susceptibility factors. We will investigate whether an islet 'overwork' response to excess nutrient loads underlies beta-cell susceptibility to failure in both types of diabetes. We will also develop novel pharmacological approaches to reduce islet 'overwork' to prevent and treat type 1 and 2 diabetes.", "title": "Targeting insulin hypersecretion to prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes", "id": "948220", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1128442", "researchers": ["Prof Marc Prentki", "Prof Stefan Broer", "Prof Christopher Nolan"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 855272.75, "fundingScheme": "Project Grants", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-03-07T07:53:30Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-05T07:47:02Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Christopher Nolan"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1128442", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1128442", "1128442"], "subjects": ["Endocrinology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "diabetes mellitus", "insulin secretion", "pancreatic islets", "amino acids", "drug development"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/948220"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop a unified model of amino acid homeostasis in mammalian cells and apply it to brain cells.
