This leads to questions such as do we value health gains to different people (e.g. young versus old) differently, or different types of health gain (improved quality of life or life extension) differently? Survey methods will be used to investigate how members of society and &ldquo;decision makers&rdquo; prioritise different types of health gain. Results will help Australia to make informed resource allocation decisions.", "title": "Social and decision maker preferences for priority setting in health care resource allocation", "id": "111970", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1047788", "researchers": ["Ms Liliana Bulfone", "Prof Dorte Gyrd-Hansen", "A/Pr Emily Lancsar", "Dr James Butler", "Prof Cam Donaldson"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 273051.66, "fundingScheme": "Project Grants", "startDate": 2013, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T07:46:04Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:22:40Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Emily Lancsar"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1047788", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1047788", "1047788"], "subjects": ["Health Economics", "ECONOMICS", "APPLIED ECONOMICS", "priority setting", "health care rationing", "health policy", "health services research", "economic evaluation"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/111970"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop and validate a new preference-based quality-of-life instrument with applications in aged-care.
