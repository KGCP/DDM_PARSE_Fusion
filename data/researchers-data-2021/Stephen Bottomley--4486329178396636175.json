It is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and the debilitating lung disease emphysema in adults. Antitrypsin is produced in the liver and secreted into the circulation. Its primary role is to inhibit the degradative enzyme elastase which attacks the tissues of the lung. A deficiency in Antitrypsin leads to uncontrolled elastase activity which destroys the lung tissue so causing emphysema. The deficiency is commonly caused by Antitrypsin being unable to enter the circulation. This is due to mutations within the Antitrypsin molecule which cause the protein to adopt an incorrect three-dimensional structure. This causes the protein to form long chains within the liver, which in turn damage the liver cell. There are no specific treatments for Antitrypsin deficiency, this partly reflects our lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. This project examines the effects of the mutations upon the folding of Antitrypsin so that we can understand how these long protein chains form. Using a range of biochemical techniques we will monitor structural changes within the normal and abnormal proteins as they fold to determine how the mutations disrupt the process. These data will allow us to begin to rationally design inhibitors which will prevent the formation of the long chains, which we hope will aid in the treatment of patients with Antitrypsin deficiency. This increased understanding of Antitrypsin deficiency may also benefit other disease processes where similar protein misfolding occurs such as amyloid and prion diseases.", "title": "Molecular analysis of alpha-1-Antitrypsin misfolding: a cause of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency", "id": "82324", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124493", "researchers": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 255837.12, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2002, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:04Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T04:47:33Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124493", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124493", "124493"], "subjects": ["320305", "fluorescence spectroscopy", "polymerisation", "protein folding", "proteinase inhibitor", "proteins", "Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency", "Emphysema", "Inflammation", "Liver disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82324"}]}, {"title": "The molecular analysis of Conformational Disease", "id": "113018", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194457", "researchers": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "description": null, "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 425000, "fundingScheme": "Career Development Fellowships", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:45:01Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:24:34Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194457", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194457", "194457"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "gene therapy", "inherited diseases"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/113018"}]}, {"description": "I am a biophysicist-structural biologist determining the mechanisms by which proteins aggregate and cause disease.", "title": "Uncoupled Research Fellowship", "id": "114992", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436670", "researchers": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 798001.94, "fundingScheme": "Research Fellowships", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2013, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-16T09:52:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T07:28:41Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436670", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436670", "436670"], "subjects": ["320305", "Biochemistry - proteim peptide", "Huntington's Disease", "Neurodegeneration", "Protein precipitation, ataxia", "Protein structure"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/114992"}]}, {"description": "tPA is an enzyme given to patients to remove stroke-causing blood clots but can have harmful effects in the brain. tPA needs a cofactor to function optimally.

These include osteoporosis, arthritis, periodontal disease, wasting diseases of muscle and inherited disorders such as antitrypsin deficiency. The five CI&rsquo;s on this application have formed a collaborative network since 1996. Dr Whisstock is a bioinformatician and structural biologist with a research focus on the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors and their protease partners. He is currently the scientific director of the Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium and an NHMRC Senior Research Fellow. Dr Bird is an NHMRC Senior Research Fellow who discovered the intracellular branch of the serpin superfamily and formulated the hypothesis that describes their function. A-Prof Mackie is a world expert in the field of musculoskeletal biology and pathology. Dr Bottomley is a Senior Logan Fellow and RD Wright Fellow whose research focuses upon how proteins misfold and lead to disease. Dr Pike is an enzymologist whose research area encompasses a wide range of bacterial and mammalian proteases involved in the pathology of human disease. Each individual in this team brings different skills which makes this a very important and powerful collaboration. The research is extensive and involves protein folding, enzyme kinetics, molecular modelling, structural biology, bioinformatics, cell biology and pathology, enzyme kinetics and drug design.
