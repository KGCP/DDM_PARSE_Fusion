My research interests include understanding natural hazard processes and important long-term dynamics informed by small-scale heterogeneities along major structural boundaries (e.g. basin, plate boundaries and core-mantle boundary). I observe these processes and heterogeneties using multiple data types including seismometers, infrasound sensor, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and model the waveforms using methods such as large-scale HPC waveform simulation and moment tensor inversion.", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [], "ANDS-Grants": []}
