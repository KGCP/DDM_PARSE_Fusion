These disorders span the entire spectrum of diseases that have a genetic component, such as autoimmune diseases and cancers, therefore influencing all age groups. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process is a priority since it is the essential knowledge required for understanding all of the factors that contribute to this array of debilitating diseases, and for devising effective preventative and diagnostic measures. To attain this understanding necessitates establishing the mechanistic origins of germline mutagenesis. Two basic approaches are employed to understand this process. The first assesses the incidence of mutation in pedigrees. This identifies the spectrum of risk mutations underlying the specific disease surveyed. Because other biological processes also influence these observations, the results from this approach do not reflect the underlying germline mutation spectra and are therefore not translatable between diseases. As mutations are rare events, it is prohibitive to obtain sufficient observations to resolve the underlying mechanisms. The second approach employs comparative genomic data, and uses differences in germline biology to estimate sex-biased effects. This comparative approach benefits from the accumulation of mutations over vast periods of time. The approach has not, however, been applied to diagnose the mechanistic origins of mutations. In this project, we will apply the enormous volume of comparative sequencing data to relate components of the mutagenic spectrum with sexual differences in germline biology. The project will differentiate between different types of mutations, and their association with specific processes will be established. The results will be a determination of the relative contributions of different mechanisms of mutation to germline mutagenesis.", "title": "Exploiting sexual differences in germline biology to resolve the causes of germline mutation", "id": "96440", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366739", "researchers": ["Prof Simon Easteal", "Prof Gavin Huttley"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 315914.3, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:51:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:30Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Gavin Huttley"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366739", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366739", "366739"], "subjects": ["Molecular Evolution", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "GENETICS", "Bioinformatics", "DNA methylation", "Germline mutation", "Phylogeny based maximum-likelihood", "Sex biased germline mutation", "Age associated mutation risk", "Factors causing germline mutation", "Inherited disorders", "Mutation risk assessment"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96440"}]}, {"description": "Lupus is the prototypic autoimmune disease. It is characterised by inflammation that can damage virtually any organ in the body. This inflammation is the outcome of a complex interplay between the environment and genetic predisposition, resulting in production of antibodies against components of normal tissue. Better characterisation of the genetic basis of lupus is a priority because it is the single best path towards a clearer understanding of the mechanism of this debilitating disease, and ultimately, new therapeutic options. Strategies used to identify the genetic basis of human disease fall into two categories. The first involves gathering genetic information from families with more than one affected member, which is then compared with genetic information from unaffected people. This can identify genetic regions likely to contain disease-causing genes, but so far, this approach has met with limited success in lupus. Although regions of the genome that harbour disease-associated genes have been found, few actual disease causing genes have been confirmed. The second approach begins with known genes that might plausibly cause the disease, based on prior knowledge then tests are performed to see whether particular variants of these genes are more common in patients than in healthy controls. Obviously this approach is usually biased towards investigation of candidate genes that are already well-characterised. In this project, we will combine information obtained from a large-scale mouse-based programme in which genetic changes that cause features of lupus are generated randomly. In other words, there is an unbiased search for candidate genes, which should lead to the discovery of new disease pathways. Since the mouse and human immune systems are remarkably similar, genetic abnormalities that cause features of lupus in mice are highly likely to be informative about the genetic basis of human lupus, a hypothesis we will test with genetic studies in humans with lupus.", "title": "Translational study of the genetics of systemic autoimmunity based on mouse mutagenesis", "id": "94895", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316914", "researchers": ["Prof Matthew Cook", "Prof Carola Vinuesa", "Prof Gavin Huttley", "Prof Christopher Goodnow"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 518500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:49:59Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:24Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Christopher Goodnow"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316914", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316914", "316914"], "subjects": ["Autoimmunity", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "IMMUNOLOGY", "Antinuclear antibodies", "ENU mutagenesis", "Human lupus alleles", "Lupus", "Mouse lupus alleles", "Autoimmune thrombocytopenia", "Systemic autoimmunity"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/94895"}]}, {"description": "Major depression is the leading cause of disability in Australia, but its causes are unknown.
