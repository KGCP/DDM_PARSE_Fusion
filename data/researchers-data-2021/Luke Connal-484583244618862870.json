Additive manufacturing has the ability to transform industries bringing manufacturing into local business and homes. However, for the true potential to be met, innovative polymer inks need to be developed. This project will develop innovative polymer inks as raw materials for affordable 3D printers. It will prepare a range of polymer inks that respond and change their properties in response to their environment, for example a temperature switch. This will enable printed objects to perform complex tasks such as shape shifting and self-healing.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180103918", "id": "1317154", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103918", "researchers": ["Dr Luke Connal"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 317288, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:43Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:36Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103918", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180103918", "DP180103918"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1317154"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to develop a facility for investigating thermodynamics and kinetics to support the next generation of researchers in chemical sciences.
