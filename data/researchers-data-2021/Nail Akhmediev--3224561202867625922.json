Explosions occur regularly in variety of systems with continuous supply and dissipation of energy. Exploding solitons are more common than ordinary dissipative solitons. They occupy large areas in the parameter space and they can be generated relatively easily. Despite this fact, the phenomenon is highly complex and requires significant research efforts to understand. If such understanding is reached, the exploding solitons can be used for generation of pulses with wide spectral output similar to ``supercontinuum&quot; radiation. Research in this direction will provide the basis for building powerful laser sources with wide spectral output.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150102057", "id": "617918", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102057", "researchers": ["Prof Dr Nail Akhmediev"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 355100, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:01Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102057", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150102057", "DP150102057"], "subjects": ["OPTICAL PHYSICS", "PHYSICAL SCIENCES", "DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS; EXPLODING SOLITONS; LASERS"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617918"}]}, {"description": "Rapid progress in rogue wave research internationally requires the further development of an accurate theory of extreme waves in deep water and in optical fibers.
