presentation including heart attack and stroke represent a major source of morbidity and mortality in the developed world, including Australia. Atherosclerosis involves the accumulation of lipid-laden cells in the wall of arteries that generates plaques resulting in a decrease in the lumen of the affected vessel that can impede or block blood flow resulting in clinical complications. The cellular events involved in atherosclerosis are complex. However, increasing information indicates that atherosclerosis involves an inappropriate response of the immune and inflammatory systems. This proposal plans to investigate the role of a protein, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that is increased during inflammation and is important for the regulation of the host's immune system. We propose that increasing IDO activity in inflammatory cells will attenuate the degree of vascular disease by decreasing the overall level of immune activation and inflammation in the blood vessels. We will test this by modulating the expression and activity of this protein in animal models of vascular disease, measure the extent of disease and then elucidate the mechanisms by which the protein acts. The significance of these studies is that they will provide useful information on the inflammatory and immune processes involved in the progression of atherosclerosis and may identify a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention.", "title": "Role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in vascular disease", "id": "97397", "institutions": ["University of New South Wales"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350916", "researchers": ["A/Pr Shane Thomas"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 271500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:50:57Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:08Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of New South Wales"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Shane Thomas"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350916", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350916", "350916"], "subjects": ["Cardiology (incl.
