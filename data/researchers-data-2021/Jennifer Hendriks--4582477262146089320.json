While the historical details of this period have been extensively researched, the linguistic effects of massive migration on the emerging urban Dutch vernaculars is virtually undocumented and remains poorly understood. This project aims to fill an important gap in our knowledge of language and society during this very turbulent and unstable period in Dutch history, thereby contributing to the larger goal of creating more realistic linguistic histories. More generally, it will contribute to the development and fine-tuning of models used to examine contact-induced change involving speakers of closely related language varieties.", "Recent conference presentations linked to this project:", "\u201cFinding needles in haystacks: Non-dominant multilingual speakers as agents of change in Early Modern Dutch.\u201d Paper presented at the workshop \u2018New historical perspectives on non-dominant speakers as agents of contact-induced language change\u2019 held the 23rd International Conference on Historical Linguistics, 31 July \u2013 4 August 2017, The University of Texas at San Antonio, USA.", "Forthcoming publications linked to this project:", "Hendriks, Jennifer. to appear.
