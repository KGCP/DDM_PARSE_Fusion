the diseased kidneys of patients with nephritis. The new protein is present in all types of nephritis that are caused by antibodies together with another part of the immune system, called the complement system, which is know to have an important role in causing tissue damage in immune diseases. The new protein is a part of the complement system but its exact function is not yet known. The protein is likely to be important in immune diseases because it is so commonly found in diseased kidneys and other organs with complement-associated disease. In this project we will conduct a series of experiments which will determine how the new protein works in the complement system and also how important the protein is in causing kidney damage in nephritis. Nephritis is the commonest cause of kidney failure in Australia and research directed towards the mechanism of kidney damage has the potential to produce new types of therapy. The complement system also has a major role in other inflammatory diseases and in body defense systems (such as protection against microbial attack). The complement system must be able to distinguish between foreign particles and the body's own tissue and this new protein may have a role in the appropriate regulation of complement to attack the right things in the body. Elucidation of the function of this protein may well assist, therefore, in developing therapies for a variety of inflammatory diseases and infectious diseases, in addition to nephritis.", "title": "Function of Factor H-related protein-5, a novel human plasma complement protein found in glomerular immune deposits", "id": "96082", "institutions": ["St. Vincent's Health"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/204705", "researchers": ["Prof Brendan Murphy", "Prof David Gordon", "Prof Peter Cowan"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 186430, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:32Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:13Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["St. Vincent's Health"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Brendan Murphy"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/204705", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/204705", "204705"], "subjects": ["321012", "Complement", "Factor H-related protein", "Glomerulonephritis", "Humoral Immunity", "Protein characterization", "Immunologic diseases", "Immunopathology", "complement activation", "glomerulonephritis", "renal failure"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96082"}]}, {"description": "This is a new approach to understanding how the Earth works, at a global-scale and billion-year perspective.
