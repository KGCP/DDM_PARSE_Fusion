These atrocities shocked Japan's Western enemies, not least because Japanese military behaviour in the early 20th century had been celebrated as remarkably humane. This project seeks to explain Japanese wartime brutality, identifying the specific circumstances in which it occurred and considering the particular wartime context. It challenges the prevalent explanation of Japanese wartime violence which locates the causes of brutality in deeply rooted aspects of Japanese national culture. This research contributes to understandings of war and violence.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150100906", "id": "617746", "institutions": ["Murdoch University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100906", "researchers": ["Prof Sandra Wilson", "Prof Robert Cribb"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 140600, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:57Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Murdoch University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100906", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100906", "DP150100906"], "subjects": ["HISTORICAL STUDIES", "HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY", "HISTORY OF VIOLENCE; JAPANESE HISTORY; WAR CRIMES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617746"}]}]}
