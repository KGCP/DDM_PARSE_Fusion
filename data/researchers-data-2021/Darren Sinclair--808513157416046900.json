Groundwater management in Australia confronts a multi-dimensional crisis stemming from neglect, over-allocations and policy mismanagement. Overcoming this will require a transformation in the regulation and governance of groundwater. The project&rsquo;s findings are expected to advance regulation and governance empirical theory, normative and applied theory and provide policy solutions for sustainable groundwater management within a pluralistic governance model. This is significant and timely given planned policy reviews in the Murray Darling Basin, the effect of climate change and plans to develop agriculture in Northern Australia.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE170101536", "id": "942874", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170101536", "researchers": ["Dr Darren Sinclair"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 346000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2017, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:28Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2017-07-04T23:44:58Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170101536", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE170101536", "DE170101536"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/942874"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to critically evaluate the practices and strategies of non-urban water compliance and enforcement in Australia and internationally, to identify and develop innovations for water governance.
