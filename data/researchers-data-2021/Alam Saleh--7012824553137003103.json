Since Dr Saleh\u2019s research has its roots in both Iranian Studies and the broader international relations of the Middle East, it increasingly seeks to examine the intersection between country-specific studies and a wider understanding of the regional system in order to examine the kinds of challenges faced in the region in terms of a range of \u201csofter\u201d security concerns, which are often felt most acutely in the domestic politics of individual states. Other research projects, currently in the planning stage, address the role of transitional identities in security and identity production in the Middle East."], "biography": "Dr Alam Saleh is Lecturer in Iranian Studies at the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University.

This research\u00a0explores the multiple dimensions of Soleimani\u2019s image, its construction, use and reception among different audiences. Bridging the gap between a traditional political biography and a work of comparative and regional politics, it places Soleimani within multiple frames of resonance, examining how his image and persona have been shaped by himself, by the regime and by outsiders to create a powerful and increasingly essential narrative which has over time placed Soleimani as a key powerbroker in Iranian and regional politics.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Persian Pride and Prejudice: Identity Maintenance and Interest Calculations among Iranians in the United Arab\r\nEmirates\"", "year": "2020", "source": "International Migration ReviewVol 54, No 2, pp. 496-526", "authors": ["Alam Saleh", "Worrall J"]}, {"title": "Political Parties and Secular-Islamist Polarisation in Post-Mubarak Egypt", "year": "2018", "source": "in Kraetzschmar, H., and Rivetti, P.
