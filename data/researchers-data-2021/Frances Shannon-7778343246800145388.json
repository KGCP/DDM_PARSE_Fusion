Some of these proteins, referred to as cytokines, are secreted by the cells and act as intercellular messengers to affect the function of other cells need for an immune response. Switching on the production of these cytokines requires the genes that produce them to interpret the complex signaling pattern to which the cell has been exposed. These complex signaling patterns are interpreted in the nucleus by molecular switches that lie beside the genes in the DNA. The incorrect production of these proteins is involved in immune diseases such as autoimmunity, allergy and leukemia. Genes are housed in the nucleus of the cell, packaged into a structure known as chromatin. When the gene is not producing protein it is tightly packaged in chromatin but when it is activated to produce protein this packaging is altered to allow the gene to see the signals being received by the cell and produce protein. We have identified a protein within the nucleus that is critical in allowing certain cytokine genes to see the signals being received in the nucleus. By investigating the role of this protein (called c-Rel) in chromatin reorganization in immune cells, we hope to better define the steps required for appropriate gene activation in an immune response.

Hence, an inappropriate T cell response can lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory disease. When T cells are activated by an immune signal they switch on the production of an array of proteins that control both T cell function and other arms of the immune system. The genes encoding these proteins possess molecular switches (promoters and enhancers) that respond to immune signals. These molecular switches bind groups of proteins known as transcription factors. One family of transcription factors that plays a key role in T cell function is the NF-kB family consisting of five different members, three of which are important in T cell function. Aberrant NF-kB function or expression has been associated with autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In addition, NF-kB proteins are key components of transplant rejection. There is enormous interest in using the NF-kB pathway as a therapeutic target for these pathologies. We currently have a detailed knowledge of the biology of these factors through studies of mice lacking specific family members. While we know some of the genes that are switched on by the NF-kB proteins, we currently lack a sufficiently detailed knowledge of NF-kB-regulated genes in order to link the molecular function with the biological outcomes. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of NF-kB function and relate this to the biological outcomes, we need a global view of NF-kB action in the cell. This proposal uses both experimental and computational approaches to decipher the gene expression program controlled by NF-kB proteins in T cells. The T cell transcription networks in which NF-kB proteins participate will also be investigated. The knowledge generated by these experiments will provide a solid basis for designing therapeutic approaches based on the NF-kB pathway.", "title": "The role of NF-kB transcription factors in regulating T cell transcription networks", "id": "99544", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316917", "researchers": ["Prof Frances Shannon"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 534000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:49:59Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:56:19Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Frances Shannon"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316917", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/316917", "316917"], "subjects": ["Gene Expression (incl.

T cells are activated by foreign antigen and respond by producing an array of soluble factors including cytokines, which act as communicators between cells. The correct expression of these factors is critical for the maintenance and function of the immune system, and is therefore tightly regulated. The genes encoding these factors are generally maintained in an 'inactive' state but are switched on rapidly when required. Within the cell, genes or DNA are found wrapped up in a complex protein structure called chromatin which plays an important role in regulating gene expression. Chromatin forms a barrier to active gene expression which must be overcome before the gene can be switched on. There are protein complexes within the cell that are able to alter or remodel chromatin structure from an 'inactive' to an 'active' state. We are investigating one of these chromatin remodeling complexes to determine which genes it is able to switch on and how it targets these particular genes. Aberrant gene expression within T cells contributes to a range of diseases including certain leukemias and inflammatory conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
