The new TEM facility at ANU will accelerate current studies, by enhancing the materials research portfolio, and extending national and international collaborations in materials, geological and earth sciences.", "title": "An analytical transmission electron microscope for the investigation of functional materials, earth processes and novel condensed matter", "id": "68468", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE100100121", "researchers": ["White Prof Tim J", "Dr Jodie E Bradby", "Prof Ray L Withers", "Dr Yun Liu", "Prof Robert G Elliman", "Dr Mark C Ridgway", "Prof Andres Cuevas", "Prof James S Williams", "Dr Yin-Yin J Wong-Leung", "Prof Chennupati Jagadish", "Dr Andrei V Rode", "Prof Ian Jackson", "Dr Daniel H Ma"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 1000000, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities", "startDate": 2010, "endDate": 2010, "dateTimeModified": "2015-08-13T17:16:07Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T02:24:42Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE100100121", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LE100100121", "LE100100121"], "subjects": ["NANOTECHNOLOGY", "TECHNOLOGY", "materials design", "materials synthesis", "microscopy", "mineralogy", "nano fabrication", "nano materials", "petrology"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/68468"}]}]}
