the islands of Bougainville (1989-98) and Guadalcanal (1998-2003). Island Melanesia is now on the brink of a major new mining boom, compelling an urgent reconsideration of the relationships between mining, violence and political fragmentation in this island region. This project will focus on the role of agrarian change and patterns of socio-economic inequality at different geographical scales, a poorly understood dimension of these relationships. The results will contribute to the development of policy approaches that minimise the risk of further violence, while also offering new theoretical insights into the complex global phenomenon of 'resource conflict'.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE140101206", "id": "518365", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE140101206", "researchers": ["Dr Matthew Allen"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 368720, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:49:59Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:07:52Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE140101206", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE140101206", "DE140101206"], "subjects": ["OTHER STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "STUDIES IN HUMAN SOCIETY", "melanesia", "political ecology", "resource conflict"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518365"}]}, {"description": "Tracking infrastructure for social media analysis: The tracking infrastructure for social media analysis (TrISMA) project establishes state-of-the-art technical and organisational infrastructure for the tracking of public communication by Australian users of social media, at large scale, in real time, and for the long term, addressing a significant gap in national research infrastructure.
