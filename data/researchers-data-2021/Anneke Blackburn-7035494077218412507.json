Some GSTs carryout important enzymatic reactions with endogenous substrates and others have important non-enzymatic functions such as the regulation of signaling pathways within cells and the modulation of calcium ion channels that are involved in muscle contractions. The generic inhibition of all GSTs could therefore have significant adverse physiological effects. We propose to make mice deficient in specific GSTs and to study their physiological responses.
