As a curator and educator, for the past decade she has worked with museums and galleries to support digital strategy, digital programming and pedagogy.\u00a0Her present work addresses the emerging paradigms of human - machine curation, as a contemporary response to the massive intensification of global image production and circulation. Funded by the SNSF, the project \"Curating Photography in the Networked Image Economy\", explores the transit of data analytics and AI imaginaries into the museum on the one hand, and discourses of aesthetic modernism and curating into the computer sciences on the other. A second strand of AHRC funded research explores the role of computational reproduction on the art object - connecting practices of art documentation to emerging discourses of adtech, digital marketing and big data."], "biography": "She serves on the Editorial Advisory Board of Photographies (Routledge) and Media:Art:Write:Now (Open Humanities Press) and the Board of Photoaccess, the ACT's centre for photography.
