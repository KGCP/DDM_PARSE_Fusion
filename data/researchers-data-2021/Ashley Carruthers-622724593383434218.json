While this drama is ongoing, to date it has been a hopeful one in which people living in precarity in periurban areas threatened by the expropriation of farming land, loss of rural livelihoods and the destruction of environments have, in an apparently impossible situation, succeeded in building new collectives that have enabled them to reconfigure a set of entrenched problems around the survival of smallholder farming in Vietnam.\u00a0 These assemblages involve reconfigured relationships with their immediate neighbours to create a renewed sense of local community, but also with the previously disconnected middle class urbanites and urban institutions (such as schools and universities) who are now their customers and collaborators. These new social ties do not stand alone, but rather are nodes in a complex new network involving an equally rich cast of non-human actors: land, organic produce, animals, waste, new infrastructures and technologies such as greenhouses, composting structures and misting irrigation systems, networks of communications, marketing, distribution, certification, and on and on. These new farming assemblages in turn act upon a rich series of ongoing \"controversies\": over food safety, chemical agriculture, land tenure, urbanisation and the status of rural people in a rapidly modernising society.", "", "", "", "Taking the Road for Play: Cyclist Appropriations of Automobile Infrastructures in Vietnam", "After declining in status and mode share sharply with the popularization of the motorcycle, cycling in Vietnam is on the rise. Urban elites who pursue sport and leisure cycling are the most visible of Vietnam\u2019s new cyclists, and they bring their sense of social mastery out onto the road with them by appropriating the nation\u2019s new, automobile-focused infrastructures as places for play and display. While motivated by self-interest, their informal activism around securing bicycle access to new bridges and highways potentially benefits all and contributes to making livable cities. These socially elite cyclists transcend the status associated with their means of mobility as they enact their mastery overautomobile infrastructures meant to usher in a new Vietnamese automobility.", "Check out the article here:\u00a0https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/transfers/8/3/trans080302.xml"], "publication": [{"title": "On the Myth of", "year": "2018", "source": "Uncivilised' Rural People in the City'in Catherine Earl (ed.), Mythbusting Vietnam, NIAS Press, 2018, pp. 163-182", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "Taking the Road for Play: Cyclist Appropriations of Automobile Infrastructures in Vietnam", "year": "2018", "source": "Transfers: interdisciplinary journal of mobility studies, vol. 8, no. 3, pp. 1-27pp", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "Cars", "year": "2017", "source": "bicycles and the fatal myth of equal reciprocitypp. 1-4pp", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "Book review: Vietnam", "year": "2017", "source": "s Socialist Servants: DomesticityClass, Gender and Identity', The Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 268 - 270pp.", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "Vietnam", "year": "2016", "source": "s New Cyclists'in P Q Minh, N V Suu, I Ang & G Hawkins (ed.), Globalization, Modernity and Urban Change in Asian Cities, Knowledge Publishing House, Hanoi, Vietnam, pp. 213-232", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "National Multiculturalism, Transnational Identities", "year": "2013", "source": "Journal of Intercultural Studies, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 214-228", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "Introduction: Risk, Opportunity and Resilience: Contemporary Vietnamese Mobilities", "year": "2012", "source": "Journal of Vietnamese Studies, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 1-9", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "The Socio-Spatial Constellation of a Central Vietnamese Village and its Emigrants", "year": "2012", "source": "Journal of Vietnamese Studies, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 122-153", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers", "Dang T"]}, {"title": "Indochine chic: Why is Vietnamese food so classy in Singapore?", "year": "2012", "source": "Anthropology Today, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 17-20", "authors": ["Ashley Carruthers"]}, {"title": "lternative multicultural subjectivities?
