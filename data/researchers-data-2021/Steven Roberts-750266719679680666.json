The project proposes to address this need by developing methodology to detect trends in air pollution concentrations and reduce measurement error in recorded air pollution concentrations. This will enable relevant authorities to produce more accurate estimates of air pollution health costs and implement more appropriate pollution regulations and health warnings.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140100551", "id": "518067", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100551", "researchers": ["Dr Steven Roberts"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 135000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:51:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:07:17Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100551", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100551", "DP140100551"], "subjects": ["PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "air pollution", "epidemiology", "population health"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518067"}]}]}
