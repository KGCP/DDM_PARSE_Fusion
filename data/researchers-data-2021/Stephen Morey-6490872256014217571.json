The Tangsa Wihu song-cycle is a ritual and poetic tradition common to people in a very linguistically diverse community situated in the India&ndash;Myanmar border region. This project plans to study this song-cycle, which was traditionally performed over many hours and days, examining the linguistic, historical and musicological features of the song in its various contexts. The rich and complex linguistic diversity of Tangsa is shining a light on traditional patterns of human linguistic and social development, and this detailed study is expected to enhance our knowledge of the linguistic and cultural diversity of India and Myanmar.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160103061", "id": "664136", "institutions": ["La Trobe University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103061", "researchers": ["Dr Stephen Morey"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 360000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["La Trobe University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103061", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160103061", "DP160103061"], "subjects": ["LINGUISTICS", "LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664136"}]}, {"description": "This project will systematically analyse nineteenth century anthropologists Lorimer Fison and A.W.
