Her doctoral research was on the design and development of reinforcement learning-based control algorithms and adaptive prediction models for glucose regulation in type 1 diabetes. Her main contribution on personalisation of insulin treatment resulted in a patent application.\u00a0After her PhD, Dr. Daskalaki was engaged for two years as project associate at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, where she worked in different engineering areas, among which, the design of control algorithms for the phase regulation of the Compact Linear Collider klystrons.\u00a0 Subsequently she was engaged at the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), Neuchatel, a private research company, first as a post-doctoral researcher and then as a R&D engineer. Her work focused on the development of signal processing algorithms for radiofrequency-based sensing applications and radar-based remote sensing of human vital signs. She led a research project on the development of machine/deep learning (ML/DL) algorithms for anomalies and events detection in multivariate time-series.\u00a0Currently, she is a research fellow in Computer Science, mainly working for the OHIOH grand challenge. Her work focuses on the development of ML/DL strategies for the improvement of diagnosis and management of diabetes and multiple sclerosis, but also expands in the broader field of data processing in medical applications.", "project": ["Journal Publications", "[1] E.
