Combining concepts with process, my approach blends responses to ethnic contexts with techniques for embedding the graphic image in glass. Using cultural contexts as specific sites, collaboration with cultural communities and museum collections inform artworks that are metaphorical and literal lenses through which to view culture. Techniques of glass printing, waterjet cutting and kilnforming are combined in unique ways to create glass artworks."], "biography": "", "project": ["Sarmiento, Jeffrey\u00a0(2019)\u00a0Graphic Swim: 2D and 3D printing in glass Casting.\u00a0MDPI Arts, 8 (29).
