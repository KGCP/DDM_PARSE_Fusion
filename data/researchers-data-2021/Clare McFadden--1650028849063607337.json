The palaeodemographic measures which I have developed and finessed use age-at-death data to estimate fertility and the rate of natural population increase. The inclusion of infants and children aged 0-4 years has seen an increase in the accuracy of such methods and is a suitable adjustment for samples from Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and potentially other parts of the world where skeletal remains are well preserved and recovered. Rigorous testing of the new measures under a variety of sample bias conditions has found them to be sufficiently accurate for application in many poor preservation, or poor recovery, scenarios.\u00a0 The application of these tools has reinforced overarching regional trends in population responses to major changes in Southeast Asia (the intensification of agriculture) and the Pacific (the first wave of human migration through the region). I have developed a new measure of maternal mortality from the age-at-death distribution, which I believe will provide exciting new insights into the causes and consequences of maternal deaths in the past, as well as the female experience of pregnancy and childbirth.My current research seeks to incorporate palaeodemography into multidisciplinary approaches to human diversity, both biological and cultural. I am building new theoretical and statistical models to explore relationships between population dynamics and sociocultural, biological and environmental variables in the past. To inform and operationalise these models, I am engaging in strongly contextualised, high resolution case studies of population processes in the past."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "stabilized maternal mortality rate estimator for biased skeletal samples", "year": "2020", "source": "Anthropological Science", "authors": ["Clare McFadden", "Van Tiel B", "Oxenham M"]}, {"title": "Rethinking the age and unity of large naturalistic animal forms in early Western Arnhem Land Rock Art, Australia", "year": "2020", "source": "Australian Archaeology, vol.
