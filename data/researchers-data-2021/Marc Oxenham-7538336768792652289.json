My chief research focus is understanding ancient human biological responses to major lifeway shifts in Southeast Asia and, more recently, Scotland and Ireland from the mid-Holocene to medieval period. I also research the processes, patterning and rate of soft and hard tissue decomposition (surface, sub-surface, and aquatic) to develop more precise models for estimating human time since death. I am active in promoting student led research, and fostering the next generation of scholars, having been primary supervisor of 29 Honours; 18 Masters (2 with the University of Aberdeen); and 11 PhD student completions in mortuary archaeology, bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology. I have been instrumental in building the ANU Biological Anthropology program (the only one of its type in Australia) from 2.5 fulltime academic staff to 5 and broadening the research and teaching focus to include primatology, the archaeology of medicine, human behavioural ecology and bone histology. Over the past decade I have volunteered a substantive amount of time as a consultant to the Australian Defence Forces.Research outputs summary\u00a0Competitive ARC & British Academy Grants: $3.75 Million; other competitive grants: $352k.

Reasons for, and consequences of, the experience of stress in human communities spanning the origin of farming (Neolithic) through to the Medieval period will be modelled in a study that utilizes the rich, but understudied human remains collections archived in UK museums. Using methods developed by Oxenham in a different geographical context and applied in the UK for the first time, the project will provide new understanding of how northern communities biologically adapted to and were resilient to the vagaries of significant change in climate, environment, technology and economy throughout antiquity. The project will significantly grow an emerging area of bioarchaeological expertise at the University of Aberdeen and will provide new pioneering techniques in the field of bioarchaeology more generally.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "paleoepidemiological approach to the osteological paradox: Investigating stress, frailty and resilience through cribra orbitalia", "year": "2020", "source": "American Journal of Physical Anthropology, vol. online, pp. 1-13", "authors": ["McFadden C", "Marc Oxenham"]}, {"title": "stabilized maternal mortality rate estimator for biased skeletal samples", "year": "2020", "source": "Anthropological Science", "authors": ["McFadden C", "Van Tiel B", "Marc Oxenham"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2020", "source": "Estimating stature using human forearm and leg anthropometric data in an Australian female sample.
