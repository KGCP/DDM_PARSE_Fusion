The explosion of genomics and proteomics data in the last two decades has created new opportunities and computational challenges to gain new biological insights. My research aims to design new models and algorithms to address these computational challenges for interpreting complex biological datasets. I am drawn to three major areas where I am solving fundamental problems in both biology and algorithms.Genome Assembly. Genome sequencing data usually consists of millions or billions of short DNA sequences, called reads, that are randomly drawn from genomes. Assembling reads into a single genome remains a difficult computational problem, especially with the recent transition from short and accurate reads (2nd generation sequencing) to long and error-prone reads (3rd generation sequencing). We generalized the classic de Bruijn graph model and developed the first assembler that bypasses the time-consuming step of correcting errors in long reads. We further proposed the repeat graph model to provide the repeat characterization necessary for producing optimal assemblies. We also resolved the long-standing issue of selecting k-mer sizes in the de Bruijn graph model.Metagenomics. Metagenomics analysis becomes a formidable computational task when researchers move from assembling genomes of individual organisms to resolving the composition of a mixture of multiple species. An essential step in metagenomics analysis is binning (taxonomic profiling of sequences). My group at ANU introduced a novel algorithm to use the assembly graph to bin metagenomic sequences, improved the typical recalls from less than 50% to above 90%\u00a0 and enabled detecting shared sequences among multiple species. Our recent work substantially outperformed state-of-the-art reference-free binning tools for long reads and made it possible to computationally separate long reads of coral genomes from its microbial symbionts.Comparative Genomics and Phylogenomics. As whole genomes are sequenced at increasing rates, using genome rearrangements for phylogenetic analysis is attracting increasing interest but remains computationally challenging. we proposed a structural characterization of a genome pair and designed efficient algorithms to estimate evolutionary distances between genomes. We found a novel way to model the biased transaction for genome rearrangements and proposed the first maximum-likelihood approach for phylogenetic inference using whole-genome data. We generalized the classic Robinson-Foulds distance to achieve better discrimination in comparing phylogenetic trees."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic":
