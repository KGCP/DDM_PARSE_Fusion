are now billions of users worldwide. The locative capacities of these devices are now widely exploited in applications (i.e. Facebook Places) that can provide users information about their surrounds and provide others information about where the user is located. These practices have implications for privacy and surveillance across public and private, local and regional contexts. 'Locating the Mobile' provides the first cross-cultural and intergenerational study of this phenomenon in three key sites (Tokyo, Shanghai and Melbourne).", "title": "Linkage Projects - Grant ID: LP130100848", "id": "516910", "institutions": ["RMIT University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP130100848", "researchers": ["A/Prof Larissa Hjorth", "Dr Heather Horst", "Prof Sarah Pink", "Dr Genevieve Bell", "A/Prof Baohua Zhou", "Dr Fumitoshi Kato"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 232160, "fundingScheme": "Linkage Projects", "startDate": 2013, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:53:16Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:05:42Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["RMIT University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP130100848", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/LP130100848", "LP130100848"], "subjects": ["CULTURAL STUDIES", "LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE", "locative media", "mobile media", "new media"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/516910"}]}]}
