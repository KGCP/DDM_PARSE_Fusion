Through a series of expanded lecture performances, it sought to discover ways in which to advance new critical positions within a totalizing technical apparatus whose very design preempts it. Between reappraisals of generative art and glitch - two approaches favored by technologically engaged artists - the project identified \u201cnot working\u201d as both accident and a condition of labour under automation. The research offers an expanded notion of the essay, understood not as a form confined to the printed page but as a methodology expanded to lecture performances, installations, videos, chatbots, and neural networks, where writing, scripting, and coding interweave. Such essays collapse distanced description in order to set the algorithmic machines into motion.", "project": [], "publication": []}, "Microsoft-Academic": [{"title": "materialities of independent publishing a conversation with aaaaarg chto delat i cite mute and neural", "year": 2013, "source": "new formations", "authors": [{"name": "jodi dean"}, {"name": "sean dockray"}, {"name": "alessandro ludovico"}, {"name": "pauline van mourik broekman"}, {"name": "nicholas thoburn"}, {"name": "dmitry vilensky"}], "id": 2764674985}, {"title": "artificial imagination deepfakes from latent space", "year": 2018, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "sean dockray"}]}, {"title": "fake news artificial intelligence and data visualisation", "year": 2017, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "sean dockray"}]}, {"title": "relations of the undercommons about the work of making unmaking and remaking organizations", "year": 2018, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "tiziana terranova"}, {"name": "john hill"}, {"name": "sean dockray"}, {"name": "adelita husnybey"}]}, {"title": "session 06 states and markets", "year": 2012, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "jeff derksen"}, {"name": "sean dockray"}, {"name": "andrea francke"}, {"name": "gabriel menotti"}, {"name": "derek fleischmann"}]}, {"title": "relations of the undercommons about the work of making unmaking and remaking organizations john hill talks to tiziana terranova", "year": 2018, "source": "", "authors": [{"name": "sean dockray"}, {"name": "adelita husni bei"}]}, {"title": "review ubuweb by kenneth goldsmith et al", "year": 2012, "source": "journal of the society of architectural historians", "authors": [{"name": "sean dockray"}], "id": 165362458}, {"title": "the public school", "year": 2011, "source": "arte y politicas de identidad", "authors": [{"name": "sean dockray"}, {"name": "caleb waldorf"}, {"name": "fiona whitton"}], "id": 2736560129}], "ANDS-Grants": []}
