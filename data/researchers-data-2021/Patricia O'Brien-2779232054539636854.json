My current ARC Future Fellowship project is concerned with the interwar colonial period, and the histories of League of Nations Mandated Territories within a long view of imperial histories from around the world. The impact of World War One on Pacific imperialism and reforged nationalisms in Australia and New Zealand after this event are some focal points of this study, as is the shifting landscape of ideas about race, gender and violence in this age of 'protective' colonialism. I explore the impact of these changed circumstances and ideas on indigenous peoples, especially in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and Samoa in a number of ways; first through a biography of the Samoan nationalist leader Ta'isi O. F. Nelson."], "biography": "I was awarded an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship at the Australian National University in 2013 for my project 'Colonialism, Violence and Resistance in the interwar Pacific: Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Samoa and beyond'.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Empires and Indigenous Worlds: Violence and the Pacific Ocean, 1760 to 1930s", "year": "2020", "source": "in Louise Edwards, Nigel Penn & Jay Winter (ed.), The Cambridge World History of Violence - Volume 4: 1800 to the Present, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 20-41", "authors": ["Patricia O'Brien"]}, {"title": "Decolonizing Pacific History and Writing Indigenous Biography Response", "year": "2019", "source": "The Journal of Pacific History, vol. 54, no. 2, pp. 278-281", "authors": ["Patricia O'Brien"]}, {"title": "League of Nations:\r\n\r\nHistories", "year": "2018", "source": "Legacies and Impact(Melbourne: Melbourne University Press)", "authors": ["Patricia O'Brien", "and Damousi J eds"]}, {"title": "", "year": "2017", "source": "200 Treasures of the Australian Museum (Sydney: Australian Museum Press)", "authors": ["Patricia O'Brien"]}, {"title": "Tautai: Samoa, World History and the Life of Ta", "year": "2017", "source": "isi O.
