Bringing together the diverse ecological and human histories of this vast region highlights the strikingly different ways that the Global South and Global North have contributed to and experienced planetary change. Until the 1970s, the southern hemisphere remained largely absent from scientific considerations of the planetary impacts of human activity. Although the International Geophysical Year had been a boon for Antarctic exploration, the Pacific and Indian Oceans remained \u2018embarrassingly unknown\u2019 south of the equator nearly a decade later. This project has two parts: 1) the study of the processes of imperialism and capitalism in the Indo-Pacific from the eighteenth century; 2) an examination of the the role of Australian climatologists and meteorologists in advancing the state of knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of climatic change and variability in the Southern Hemisphere.", ""], "publication": [{"title": "Doing environmental history in urgent times", "year": "2020", "source": "History Australia, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 230-251", "authors": ["Holmes K", "Gaynor A", "Ruth Morgan"]}, {"title": "Water Flourishing in the Anthropocene", "year": "2019", "source": "Cultural Studies Review, vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 135-52", "authors": ["Cattelino J", "Drew G", "Ruth Morgan"]}, {"title": "The Continent without a Cryohistory?
