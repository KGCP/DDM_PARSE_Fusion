Multicore computers have become ubiquitous over the last decade, now being standard in everything from laptops to mobile phones. Their benefits are clear &ndash; better performance leading to more sophisticated applications. Key to ensuring those benefits are complex, and often subtle, algorithms that exploit the parallelism that multicore computers offer. This project aims to lay foundations for extending those benefits to applications where high reliability is a concern. It plans to do so by developing theoretical results about the correctness of algorithms on standard multicore computers, and practical tools and techniques to help programmers of multicore computers to better understand the behaviour of their code.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP160102457", "id": "664056", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102457", "researchers": ["A/Prof Graeme Smith", "Prof John Derrick"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 285000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2016, "endDate": 2020, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:37Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102457", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP160102457", "DP160102457"], "subjects": ["COMPUTATION THEORY AND MATHEMATICS", "INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/664056"}]}]}
