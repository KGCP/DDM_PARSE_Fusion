However, of late I have been working more on achieving an understanding of a particular set of origin-of-death myths from south-east Papua New Guinea in which the origin of death is inextricably and very explicitly linked to the origin of culture.I\u00a0have two projected papers on the grammar of Mekeo, the Austronesian language that I initially described for my doctorate (see Towards a Lexicogrammar of Mekeo. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics. 1998). The first paper deals with an emergent passive voice in Mekeo and related languages, the second with the somewhat unusual consonantal inventories of the four Mekeo dialects.\u00a0In 2013, 2014 and 2015\u00a0I published\u00a0book chapters dealing with discourse and communication in the context of professional accounting practice. In the first\u00a0I focused on the role of communicative expertise in accounting work, while the second (with Samantha Sin) deals with the nature of critical thinking in accountancy.Publications on professional discourse, discourses of ethics, and trust:Jones, A. and Sin, S.
