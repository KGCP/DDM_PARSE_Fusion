Without concrete evidence, governments often act on the assumption that the public holds punitive attitudes. This project develops an evidence base to inform policy on parole at a crucial time when governments are under pressure to restrict its use. Three mixed-method studies will assess: what public views on parole are, why the public holds these views, and what influence these views have on policy and practice. The project makes a contribution to (1) creating information strategies that properly inform the public, (2) supporting prisoner reintegration strategies, and (3) shaping criminal justice policies based on informed community feedback.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP150100569", "id": "617700", "institutions": ["University of Queensland"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100569", "researchers": ["Dr Robin Fitzgerald", "Dr Adrian Cherney", "Dr Lorana Bartels", "Prof Catherine Warner"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 235780, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:01:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Queensland"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100569", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP150100569", "DP150100569"], "subjects": ["LAW", "LAW AND LEGAL STUDIES", "OFFENDER REINTEGRATION; PAROLE ; PUBLIC OPINION"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/617700"}]}, {"description": "The media consistently claim that the public wants tougher sentences for sex offenders and politicians often respond by passing punitive sentencing measures like mandatory penalties.
