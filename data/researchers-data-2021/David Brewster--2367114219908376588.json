malnutrition. We have discovered that underlying small intestinal damage in these children is an important contributor to the high complication rates and longer lengths of stay in hospital compared to non-Aboriginal children. This research proposes to continue our work on small intestinal damage by using two non-invasive tests of gut function, namely a sugar absorption test and novel breath test. The sugar permeability test involves the children drinking a solution of the two sugars lactulose and rhamnose, and measuring their absorption into the blood 90 minutes later using a sophisticated measuring instrument called HPLC, which can measure minuscule amounts of sugars and is set up at Royal Darwin Hospital. The breath test involves children drinking another sugar solution with a special non-radioactive marker called a stable isotope of carbon, and measuring changes in the amount of this marker in carbon dioxide from the breath at timed periods after drinking the sugar solution. The breath is analysed in Adelaide using another sophisticated instrument. These tests are being used to measure abnormal sugar absorption due to intestinal damage, which is particularly common in Aboriginal children during the weaning period of 4-18 months. Our hypothesis is that treatment with 'healthy germs' (probiotics) like those in certain yoghourts will colonise the gut, stimulate immunity and reduce the presence of 'nasty germs' (pathogenic bacteria) in the intestines of Aboriginal children which contribute to the need for their hospitalisation with diarrhoea and malnutrition. If this hypothesis is correct, then this research will provide the best kind of evidence for reducing the need for hospital treatment by treating all cases of diarrhoea with these probiotics and possibly even decreasing the gut damage of children in the weaning period by including probiotics in their diets", "title": "ProbioticTreatment of Diarrhoeal Disease and Malnutrition in Top End Aboriginal Children", "id": "98178", "institutions": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160038", "researchers": ["Prof David Brewster", "Prof Geoffrey Davidson", "Prof Ross Butler"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 332036.72, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:23Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:49Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["The Flinders University of South Australia"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof David Brewster"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160038", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160038", "160038"], "subjects": ["321019", "Breath Tests", "Controlled Clinical Trials", "Enteric Infections", "Intestinal Absorption", "Probiotics", "Dehydration", "Diarrhoea", "Lactose Intolerance", "Malabsorption", "Protein-Energy Malnutrition"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98178"}]}, {"description": "The impact of the living environment on health has been well documented in the last 150 years and it is widely acknowledged that improvements in the living, working and social conditions of industrial countries have resulted in dramatic improvements in health. In Australia the close correlation between an unhealthy environment and the poor health of the Indigenous population has been clearly recognised. In 1993-94 the Federal Government established infrastructure projects as a component in the implementation of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy. The selection of communities for funding has been based on need, and the Northern Territory has attracted funding support disproportionate to its total population, but consistent with the level of need. While there is wide acceptance of the relationship between the household environment and health status, and evidence to support this general relationship, there is a need at an international and local level for research that informs specific social policy decisions. The aim of the proposed study is to determine the impact of improvements in household infrastructure on the health of children living in remote Aboriginal communities with a view to informing the development of infrastructure projects. The outcomes of this project will be a significant advance in the understanding of the relationship between the household environment and health status, and of the improvements in health that can be achieved through improvement in household infrastructure. The relationship between specific components of household infrastructure and the ability to conduct each of a number of healthy living practices will be defined, to our knowledge, for the first time. There is a unique opportunity in the Northern Territory to conduct world class research in this area. The new information will be of value in the planning of infrastructure projects in remote Indigenous communities across Australia and in similar settings internationally", "title": "The Impact of Household Infrastructure Improvements on Child Health in Remote Aboriginal Communities", "id": "100886", "institutions": ["Menzies School of Health Research"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236205", "researchers": ["Prof Gary Robinson", "Prof David Brewster", "Dr Steven Guthridge", "Prof Ross Bailie", "A/Pr Zhiqiang Wang"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 413350, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:57Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:57:24Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Menzies School of Health Research"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ross Bailie"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236205", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236205", "236205"], "subjects": ["321202", "Child health", "Environmental Epidemiology", "Housing improvements", "Indigenous health", "Housing", "gastroenteritis", "respiratory infections", "skin infections"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100886"}]}]}
