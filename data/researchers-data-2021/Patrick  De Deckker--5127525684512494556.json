However, there is scant published information on the chemical and biological composition of airborne dust from the Australian continent. For example, an isotopic comparison of aeolian material from the southern continents with dust recovered in Antarctic ice cores listed only 5 samples for the entire Australian continent, and consequently argued for a Patagonian source during glacial periods for dust recovered at Vostok and EPICA Dome C. We now have published a paper further demonstrating the link between dust recovered in Antarctic ice cores and dust sources in the Murray Darling Basin [De Deckker, P., Norman, M., Goodwin, I. D., Wain, A., Gingele , F.X. 2010. Lead isotopic evidence for an Australian source of aeolian dust to Antarctica at times over the last 170,000 years, Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 285, 205-223.]", "Thus far, we have undertaken an intensive, multidisciplinary and collaborative analysis of dust from the October 22, 2002 \"Canberra dust storm\" event [see McTainsh et al. Atmospheric Environment 39, 1227-1236 (2005) for a description of the event]. Interestingly, DNA from 75 different microbial species was extracted from the dust by Drs R. Abed and D. de Beer from the Max-Planck Institute of Marine Microbiology in Bremen, and a great variety of organic compounds were also found by Dr E. Schefuss and Prof. Kai-Uwe Hinrichs from the University of Bremen. Dr J.-B. Stuut, from the same institution, studied the sedimentological aspect of the dust. Using a variety of geochemical and palynological [by Dr S. van der Kaars of Monash] 'fingerprinting' analyses, including investigations of Nd and Sr isotopes [made by Dr M. Norman from the Research School of Earth Sciences at ANU] linked the dust that rained down in Canberra to the Bourke area of western NSW. Investigation of the meteorological events at this time by Prof. N. Tapper and Dr T. O'Loingsigh, both from Monash, corroborated with these results. Our results were published in G-3 [De Deckker, P., Abed, R. M. M., de Beer, D., Hinrichs, K., O'Loingsigh, T., Schefu\u00df, E., Stuut, J. W., Tapper, N. J., van der Kaars, s. 2008, Geochemical and microbiological fingerprinting of airborne dust that fell in Canberra, Australia, in October 2002, Geochem Geophys. Geosyst., 9, Q12Q10, doi:10.1029/2008GC002091]. Current investigatiosn concern the analysis of samples collected during the large dust storms that affected a large part of eastern Australia in September 2009.", "Finally, preliminary investigations by Dr G. Allison, Mr C. Munday and Mr D. Stephenson [from the ANU Medical School] of the microbiological communities isolated from aerosols pumped at sea offshore Australia has commenced and the results are being prepared for publication.", "For further details on our work on the Canberra dust event, visit the following web site: http://www.anu.edu.au/CSEM/newsletters/2006/MMAug06.pdf", "We successfully completed the mapping of the some of the deep-sea canyons that was commenced during the AUSTREA and AUSCAN cruises on the L'Atalante and Marion Dufresne vessels in 1999/2001 and 2003 respectively [see other report entitled 'Deep-sea Canyons']. As a result, we now have a high-resolution map of the Sprigg Canyon. We have identified that some of the conduits [channels] in several of the canyons are definitely transporting upper slope material down to the abyss.", "We found, by attempting to core the large, deep holes located at great depths [> 4.5km] below the canyons that they are not sites of substantial sedimentation. In addition, we did not find any hydrochemical anomaly that could have been generated by fluid/gas emission, although we did not manage to rest the CTD equipment on the floor of the holes.  In addition, we located the position of ancient courses of the Murray across the Lacepede Shelf and discovered the presence of an extensive estuary that would have been dammed by outcrops and possibly a large dune field.   We traced the ancient courses of the River Murray for the last glacial-interglacial period, with one possible exception that may go as far as the mid-Pleistocene. No evidence was found for much older geomorphic features, assuming either that they were eroded away or that the sub-bottom profiling equipment did not permit us to penetrate deeper into the sedimentary sequences. However, in most cases, recognised fluvial features did sit directly on the basement.", "We obtained good CTD data down to great depths [>5,000m] in the canyons [perhaps the deepest CTD obtained with the Southern Surveyor] and these will prove very useful for future research on deep water. In conclusion, we have a better understanding of the nature of the deep-sea canyons offshore Kangaroo Island. These sites are likely to be visited by cetaceans and will be of use to future biological surveys in the region. We have found ancient lacustrine deposits that have the potential, if cored, to provide information on past climatic regimes that affected Australia during a very wet period coinciding with the filling of the Willandra Lakes [e.g. Mungo] and the extensive river flows registered in the Murray Darling Basin. We have mapped possible ancient courses of the ancestral River Murray offshore Portland and discovered significant undersea slides that potentially could cause tsunamis.", "We have commenced a program of filtering air at sea to determine the nature of aerosols and identify their microbiological contents.

Together these institutions make up the Asian Neighbours Global Change Network, whose secretariat is located at the University of Sydney.  The University of the Sea programme was funded by grants from the Toyota Foundation in Japan, the Australian Earth Systems Science Network (through the ARC), and the Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research. The programme is made possible by the support of the French Polar Institute (IPEV) who host the University of the Sea onboard their research vessel the Marion Dufresne. The University of the Sea is dedicated to building marine science capacity in the Asia Pacific region. It aims to bring together senior researchers and young local scholars to address marine science issues of direct interest to the region. The programme endeavours to give these students the opportunity to gain the skills and knowledge required for participation in the global debate on the use of the ocean. The first University of the Sea training program took place in the Coral Sea - Arafura Sea region onboard the French research vessel Marion Dufresne between June 24 and July 8, 2005. The ship sailed from Port Moresby (PNG) to Darwin (Australia).  During this two-week period, twenty students representing ten countries [Australia, P.R. China, East Timor, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Sri Lanka] got \"hands on\" practical experience in both marine data collection and marine research problem solving. The students were under the supervision of Professor Patrick De Deckker (Australian National University) and Assoc. Professor Jock Keene (The University of Sydney). The second University of the Sea training program took part in 2006 with the cruise departing from Auckland on February 7 and went via Noumea, to finish in Sydney on February 26. The shipboard programme was supervised by Drs Jock Keene and Julie Dickinson from the University of Sydney, Dr Greg Skilbeck from the University of Technology Sydney, and Professor Patrick De Deckker from the Australian National University. The University of the Sea students joined a research program developed by marine geoscientists from Geoscience Australia. It was part of their 'Lord Howe Rise Project' to evaluate the gas hydrates ('frozen' methane) in the sediments.  Geoscience Australia's survey was primarily involved in the collection of six giant CALYPSO piston cores over areas of possible gas hydrate (bottom simulating reflectors, BSRs) on the northern Lord Howe Rise. In addition to the coring program, swath, sub-bottom profiler, gravity and magnetometer data were collected on transits to and from the sampling sites. These data provided detailed information on the bathymetry and structure of the seafloor and underlying geology, particularly of the continental margin of central and northern New South Wales and of the eastern flank of the Lord Howe Rise. Also, a small number of dredge hauls were taken during the swath mapping on the eastern flank of the Rise.
