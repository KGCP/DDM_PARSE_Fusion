In business history,  my current research focuses on (a) headquarter-subsidiary relations in  MNEs and the strategic responses of both to risk in host countries, and  (b) market development and perceptions of corporate social  responsibility in Indonesia. My current research in international  business relates to (a) the organisation and strategy of Japanese firms  and their subsidiaries in Southeast Asia, and (b) barriers to trade and  investment between Australia and the countries of the European Union. In  economic history, ny research focuses on the explnanation of long-term  economic growth in Indonesia, particularlythe role of institutions in  market development. In\u00a0development  economics my current research interest is the nexus of international food aid and trade to less-developed countries in Asia.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Turning adversity into opportunity: Philips in Australia 1945-1980", "year": "2018", "source": "Enterprise & Society, 19(1) 179-207", "authors": ["Pierre van der Eng"]}, {"title": "European integration and Australian manufacturing industry: The case of Philips Electronics, 1960s-1970s", "year": "2017", "source": "Australian Economic History Review, 57(2) 217-238", "authors": ["Pierre van der Eng"]}, {"title": "Managing political imperatives in war time: Strategic responses of Philips in Australia, 1939-1945", "year": "2017", "source": "Business History,\r\n 59(5) 645-666", "authors": ["Pierre van der Eng"]}, {"title": "fter 200 years, why is Indonesia", "year": "2016", "source": "s land cadastre still incomplete?'in McCarthy, John F. and Robinson, Kathryn (eds.)
