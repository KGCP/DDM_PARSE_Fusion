respiration-related metabolism in terrestrial vegetation liberates considerable amounts of CO2, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide in the atmosphere. Such gaseous losses are detrimental to biomass production but respiration also sustains nutrient assimilation and biosyntheses.

The project exploits stable isotopes to quantify metabolic partitioning and show coordination between major processes. It will thus establish key mechanisms by which respiration dictates plant carbon balance and contributes to identifying metabolic bottle-necks in plant primary production.", "title": "Future Fellowships - Grant ID: FT140100645", "id": "618372", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140100645", "researchers": ["Prof Dr Guillaume Tcherkez"], "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 865692, "fundingScheme": "Future Fellowships", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2018, "dateTimeModified": "2018-10-02T04:21:54Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140100645", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT140100645", "FT140100645"], "subjects": ["PLANT BIOLOGY", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "ISOTOPE AND FLUXES; LEAF RESPIRATION; N", "S AND C1 METABOLISM"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618372"}]}, {"description": "This project aims to fill a major gap in Australia's metabolic analytical infrastructure by making available an automated, high-resolution, two-dimensional gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
