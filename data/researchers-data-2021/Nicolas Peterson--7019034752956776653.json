This Linkage grant is held with the Central Land Council and the Strehlow Research Centre, both of Alice Springs. The researchers involved are: Dr Anna Kenny post doctoral fellow; Dr John Henderson, linguist from the University of Western Australia; Michael Cawthorn, Director of the Strehlow Research Centre; Helen Wilmot, anthropologist at the Central Land Council; and myself.", "The first results of the is project appeared with the publication of Dr Anna Kenny's book \"The Aranda' pepa\" by ANU Press which can be downloaded free in electronic form from the Press's website or bought in hard copy. A co-edited book by myself and Anna Kenny on \"German ethnography in Australia\" appeared late in 2017 and \u00a0by mid-2018 Carl Strehlow's dictionary, accompanied by five introductory essays, will also be in print.", "This project had three interconnected aims:", "* To bring the last major ethnography of classical Aboriginal life into the world of Australian scholarship by setting out its ethnographic significance to Aboriginalist anthropology and in so doing exploring the contribution of the neglected German tradition of humanistic anthropology to contemporary issues and debates. * To repatriate Indigenous intellectual property by collaborating with Arrernte and Luritja speakers to translate Carl Strehlow's unpublished 10,000 word dictionary and other cultural materials currently unavailable to them because of the language and scripts in which they are written, or being research notes and, * To examine the relationship, and sources of difference, between the work of TGH Strehlow and that of his father Carl in the areas of genealogy, territorial organisation, mythology, and totemism as a contribution to reducing contemporary conflict over traditional lands in particular, and to understanding the trajectories of change in Arrernte and Luritja social orders in the 20th century", "Carl Strehlow\u2019s seven-volume work on the Arrernte (Aranda) and Luritja, Die Aranda- und Loritja St\u00e4mme in Zentral-Australien, is the last ethnography of classical Aboriginal life that has yet to be brought into the wider world of Aboriginalist scholarship. There are several reasons for its neglect. The most obvious is that it is in German and that there is a lack of a published translation because senior Arrernte men are concerned about the amount of restricted information throughout the text. There is also an important academic reason that relates to the history of Australian anthropology. Sir Baldwin Spencer saw Carl\u2019s views on aspects of Arrernte culture as a threat to his ethnographic authority and from as early as 1903 began to attack Carl\u2019s work, and his bona fides as an ethnographer.\u00a0 Spencer claimed Carl\u2019s reports were tainted by his status as a missionary, but an equally fundamental issue was the difference in intellectual traditions: Carl\u2019s humanistic anthropology was deeply at odds with Spencer\u2019s biologically influenced social evolutionary views.\u00a0 Spencer\u2019s position as Professor of Biology at the University of Melbourne, the great acclaim received by his two ethnographies of central Australia, written with Frank Gillen, (1899, 1904), and the wide availability of these two books further combined to completely marginalise Carl\u2019s profoundly rich work.", "This project has rpreented a unique opportunity for collaboration between the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University, the Strehlow Research Centre, the Central Land Council and senior Arrernte speakers to make available to both Aboriginal people, and the world of scholarship, the dictionary and other material that are rich in cultural heritage significance for Aboriginal people. This ethnographic material is also highly relevant to understanding the changes that have taken place in Arrernte and Luritja social orders since the beginning of the 20th century, helpful in clarifying issues creating tensions in present day society especially in relation to land, and in enriching the history of Australian anthropology.", "Dr Kenny has worked with Arrernte and Luritja linguists to translate the dictionary from German into English starting from the original manuscript with technical advice on dictionary making from Dr Henderson. She will also write a book on the work of Carl Strehlow. Mr Cawthorn and Ms Wilmot worked on the clarification and elaboration of the genealogies, especially as they relate to land and Professor Peterson focused on the place of Ronald and Catherine Berndt who he believes were the last exemplars of the German humanistic tradition, until the recent arrival of a wave of new scholars trained in Germany, in the history of Australian anthropology.", "", "Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community through the visual record (ARC Linkage grant LP100200359, 2010-2013). This ARC Linkage grant is held with Papunya Tula Artists Ltd and the National Museum of Australia, Professor Fred Myers of New York University, Dr Peter Thorley of the National Museum of Australia, and Ms Philippa Deveson and myself of ANU. Together with the members of the Kintore community we will be using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal period in Pintupi history. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian Dunlop accompanying Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people still living a nomadic life in central Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same people, now living at Yayayi outstation where Fred Myers was carrying out his doctoral fieldwork.", "People like the Pintupi have been referred to as 'People without History'. Such a view emphasises the difficulty of creating a history when they have no written records of their own. This is culturally compounded by the lack of any notion of a chronological career or biographical narrative among many remote Aboriginal people. Rather, Pintupi lives and past events are encompassed in a rich array of contextually elicited or triggered stories about particular episodes and events. This leads to episodic accounts of the past that obscure the persistence of motivations, the long-term commitment to particular courses of action and the ways people have consistently worked towards specific goals, making their lives seem fragmented, reactive and lacking in clear direction. However, with a layered dialogic approach, incorporating multiple perspectives, it is possible to work collaboratively to overcome these difficulties and create a nuanced and evidence based narrative account of intent and purpose that can bridge this cultural difference in historical consciousness.", "Pintupi Dialogues is built around a unique research resource ideally suited to the cultural specificities of the Pintupi historical consciousness:", "- thirteen hours of raw synchronous sound film, shot by internationally renowned \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ethnographic filmmaker Ian Dunlop at the Pintupi outstation of Yayayi in 1974, and", "- over 600 still photographs, taken by Dunlop in 1964 of some of the same people, \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0and their parents, when they were living a completely independent traditional life \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'beyond the frontier'.", "Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue between Myers and the Pintupi we will reconstruct an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition in their lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.", "Such a history is important to the Pintupi, faced as they are with a burgeoning young population and the rapid disappearance of people who have knowledge of this transition. It will help the younger generation understand what those making the transition struggled for, and how against seemingly insuperable odds, they first got their own outstation at Yayayi, eventually leading to their own towns of Kintore and Kiwirrkura in the remoteness of the western desert. Not only was this a struggle for self-determination but it was also a crucial period when they came to terms with the cash economy by becoming involved in the Papunya Tula art movement. For the project team the history is important\u00a0for an additional reason: it will be a gateway to examining the origins and development\u00a0of self-determination as manifested in the outstation movement and the moral and\u00a0humanitarian concerns behind government policy as it sought a mutual accommodation with Pintupi people.", "Anthropological and Aboriginal perspectives on the Donald Thomson Collection: material culture, collecting and identity (ARC Linkage grant 2003-2006). In conjunction with Museum Victoria, Dr Louise Hamby, post doctoral fellow, and I, from the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University, and Ms Lindy Allen, Senior Curator, from Museum Victoria have been working on the Donald Thomson Arnhem Land Collection made between 1935-43. His Arnhem Land Collection of photographs, objects and notes together form the most comprehensive record of any fully functioning, self-suporting Aboriginal society we shall every have. The project has involved, among other things, digital modes of repatriation, extensive field based documentation of the many hundreds of images, exploration of material culture and ethnotechnology and research on Donald Thomson's place in Australian anthropology. Many Indigenous knowledge holders have been brought down to work at the Museum with the more than 4,500 objects and over 2000 photographs as well. Work related to this project will continue well into the future.", "Warlpiri songlines: anthropological, linguistic and Indigenous perspectives (ARC Linkage grant 2005-2007). In conjunction with the Warlpiri Janganpa Association, and the Central Land Council, the School of English at the University of Queensland and the Schools of Music and Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University have a three year research project into Warlpiri songlines. The project combines anthropologists, linguists, musicologists, Indigenous knowledge holders and Indigenous bicultural linguists to record, transcribe and translate many of the cycles of songs that are no longer frequently performed, and, therefore, not being passed on to the younger generations. Warlpiri songs link ancestral power with the landscape, emotions and aesthetics and are central to Warlpiri religious life. The project is creating a cultural archive at Yuendumu informed by indigenous exegesis that is also integrating appropriate aspects into the world of scholarship and eventually providing materials for Warlpiri school curricula. This project includes a postgraduate research student, Georgia Curran, who is working with Warlpiri collaborations over a fifteen month period at Yuendumu, Dr Mary Laughren, Dr Stephen Wild and Ms Anna Meltzer.
