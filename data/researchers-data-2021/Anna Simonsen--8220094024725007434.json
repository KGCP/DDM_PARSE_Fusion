This project will generate new knowledge about the process of adaptation in symbiotic bacteria, by measuring genomic changes. Expected outcomes of this project include enhanced capacity to design ecological or genetic manipulations of soil bacteria to augment plant survival and health. Anticipated benefits include enhanced woodland restoration in a biodiversity hotspot, options to mitigate habitat damage from climate change, and strategies to increase agricultural productivity with less fertiliser.", "title": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Grant ID: DE180100046", "id": "1314928", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100046", "researchers": ["Dr Anna Simonsen"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "institutions": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 365058, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Early Career Researcher Award", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:28Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:08Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": null, "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100046", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DE180100046", "DE180100046"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1314928"}]}]}
