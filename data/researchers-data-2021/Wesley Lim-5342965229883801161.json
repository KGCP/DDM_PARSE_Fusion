My research focuses on depictions of and discourses on dance in German and Austrian Literature and Film. I am also interested in exploring screendance as well as figure skating studies (particularly in an East German context). I have previously taught at Miami University of Ohio and Colorado College. My articles have appeared or are forthcoming in publications in Germanic Studies (eg. German Politics and Society, German Studies Review, Feminist German Studies, Seminar: A Journal of Germanic Studies, the Journal of Austrian Studies), Dance Studies (eg. Dance Chronicle, Dance Research Journal), Screen Studies (eg. Studies in European Cinema, Canadian Journal of Film Studies) and Performance and Cultural Studies (eg. TDR: The Drama Review, Kulturpoetik).", "project": ["Dancing with the Modernist City: Metropolitan Dance Texts around 1900 (Under advanced contract with the University of Michigan Press)", "My first book examines the work of German-speaking authors such as Harry Graf Kessler, Rainer Maria Rilke, August Endell, Alfred D\u00f6blin, and Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler who flocked to dynamic metropolises like Berlin and Paris to engage with other artists and intellectuals. In their writing from that period, they depicted the perpetual influx of stimuli caused by urban life\u2014hordes of pedestrians, bustling traffic, bombarding advertisements, etc. These authors also partook in fl\u00e2nerie: they went on long, aimless walks through the city observing the everyday objects and events on the surface, paying attention not to their utility but to their fleeting aesthetic values. This way of viewing metropolitan movement repeatedly paralleled the writers\u2019 experiences of watching early modern dance performances by Lo\u00efe Fuller, Ruth St. Denis, and Vaslav Nijinsky, whose experimental styles broke away from balletic form. The convergence these writers saw between the unexpected encounters during their urban strolls and experimental dance performances gave rise to forms of writing that interwove the two motifs.", "Drawing from dance, performance, urban, and German cultural studies, this monograph analyzes an array of material from 1896-1914\u2014essays, novels, short stories, poetry, newspaper articles, photographs, posters, and drawings. I argue that these writers and artists created a genre I am calling the metropolitan dance text, which depicts dancing figures not on a traditional stage, but essentially in and with the urban setting: the streets, advertising pillars, theaters, cafes, squares, and even hospitals. This genre of writing highlights the visual, the episodic unexpectedness of urban encounters, and kinesthetic empathy: by making the protagonist and the reader feel like they embody the dancer and the movement. Furthermore, these literary depictions question traditional conceptualizations of space and performance since the metropolitan environment begins dancing with the dancer. In some cases, the aesthetic realm of dance and the social space of the everyday city coalesce.", "The Performance of Politics and Identity on Ice: East German Figure Skating Culture (tentatively titled)", "My second book project will investigate the degree to which costuming, music choice, choreography, and public persona can reflect both socialist realist and capitalist representation in the performances of Olympic figure skating champions such as Gaby Seyfert, Jan Hoffmann, Anett P\u00f6tzsch, and Katarina Witt from the former German Democratic Republic. Much like other popular team sports, figure skating can be symptomatic of societies\u2019 larger issues in regard to politics, international relations, global feminism and masculinity.", "", "", "", "Past Grants", "DAAD Faculty Summer Seminar, 2017 - \u201cRethinking Performance in Theory and Practice - University of Chicago", "Fulbright - DAAD Summer Academy in Leipzig, 2017", "Berlin Program for Advanced German and European Studies Research Fellowship, Free University Berlin, 2009-2010", "DAAD Graduate Research Scholarship, 2009-2010 (offer declined)", "Stipendium von der Studienstiftung des Abgeordenetenhauses von Berlin, 2009-2010 (offer declined)", "", "", "", "Accepted and Forthcoming Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles", "\u201cA Mode of Agitation Between Verfremdungseffekt and Empathy: Breaking the Fourth Wall in Craig Gillespie\u2019s I, Tonya (2018)\u201d (Accepted for publication on 5 Feburary 2021 to Canadian Journal of Film Studies) (University of Toronto Press)", "\u201cBeginning the Legacy of GDR Figure Skating but Stopping Short: Gaby Seyfert\u2019s Performance of her Eigensinn\u201d (Accepted for publication on 16 September 2020 in Feminist German Studies) (University of Nebraska Press)", "\u201cReimagining the Brown Body: Drawing from Contact Improvisation and Developing an Alternative Masculinity in William Forsythe\u2019s Screendance Alignigung (2016) (Accepted for publication on 17 July 2020 in TDR: The Drama Review) (MIT Press)", "\u201cBodies in Color, Black and White, and in Piles: The Dichotomy of Concentration Camp Aesthetics and Somatic Dance Practices in J\u00f6rg Jeshel\u2019s, Brigitte Kramer\u2019s, and Sasha Waltz\u2019s Screendance K\u00f6rper (2000)\u201d (Accepted for publication on 13 November 2019 in German Studies Review) (Johns Hopkins University Press)", "", "https://anu-au.academia.edu/WesleyLim"], "publication": [{"title": "Gestural Imaginaries: Dance and Cultural Theory in the Early Twentieth Century by Lucia Ruprecht (review)", "year": "2020", "source": "German Studies Review, vol. 43, no. 1, pp. 181-183", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "Skating Toward Americanization: The Evolution of Katarina Witt throughout the 1980s", "year": "2019", "source": "German Politics and Society, vol. 37, no. 131, pp. 44-75", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "The Wildness of Tonya Harding", "year": "2019", "source": "s First Triple Axel on Live Television'Peephole Journal, issue 13, pp. online", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "n Enhanced Otherworldliness: Thierry De Mey", "year": "2018", "source": "s Screendance Based on William Forsythe's One Flat Thingreproduced , Dance Research Journal, vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 47-66", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "The specter of Pina Bausch: enhancing the\r\npossibilities of Tanztheater through film in Wim Wenders", "year": "2018", "source": "s Pina (2011)'Studies in European Cinema, pp. 16pp", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "Spiritual Selfishness: The Limitations of\r\nDance in Klaus Mann", "year": "2017", "source": "s Der fromme Tanz\r\nand Die zerbrochenen Spiegel  Seminar, vol. 53, no. 2, pp. 159-178", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "Bridging Gesture, Gesticulation, and Early Modern Dance: Rilke", "year": "2016", "source": "s Veitst\u00e4nzer in The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge'Dance Chronicle, vol. 39, no. 3, pp. 279-298", "authors": ["Wesley Lim"]}, {"title": "From Ritual Dance to Flight?
