Her work focuses on comparative political behaviour and the factors that explain differences among citizens and countries. After completing a master thesis at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al on gender differences in political interest among teenagers, she moved to Calgary to pursue a Ph.D. in political science. Her dissertation investigated how political institutions can provide incentives and barriers that affect citizens' political participation differently according to their gender. Dr Beauregard's current projects focus on women's representation in Australian political parties and the impact of sexist attitudes on political behaviour. She was awarded a Discovery for Early Career Research Award fellowship by the Australian Research Council for 2020-2022 to investigate the role of political parties in contributing to gender differences in political engagement. Her previous work has been published in the Australian Journal of Political Science, European Journal of Political Research, Journal of Women, Politics and Policy, Politics, Groups and Identities, and Political Research Quarterly.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "The merit of party institutions: Women", "year": "2020", "source": "s descriptive representation and Conservative parties in
