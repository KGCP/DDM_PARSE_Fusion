We always look for dedicated undergraduate or master students to  join us, to do creative work in rapidly growing field and generate co-authored publications.", "1. MEMS/NEMS based novel biomedical devices", "The ability to detect bio-molecule at ultra-low concentrations (e.g. atto-molar) will enable the possibility of detecting diseases earlier than ever before. A critical challenge for any new bio-sensing technology is to optimize two metrics --- shorter analysis time, and higher concentration sensitivity in clinically relevant small volumes. Moreover, practical considerations are equally important: simplicity of use, mass producible (low cost), and ease of integration within the clinical structure. Compared with other methods, nano-electro-mechanical system (NEMS) based bio-sensors are promising in clinical diagnostics because of their extremely high mass sensitivity, fast response time and the capability of integration on chip. We have demonstrated a low concentration DNA (atto-molar sensitivity) optically interrogated ultrasonic mechanical mass sensor, which has ordered nanowire (NW) array on top of a bilayer membrane. This method represents a mass-based platform technology that can sense molecules at low concentrations, which could be useful for early-stage disease detection. We can develop this sensor further to measure an array of biomarkers (e.g. DNA or proteins), by providing both the needed specificity and sensitivity in physiological disease (e.g. cancer) detection.", "Recommended references:", "2. Nonlinearity engineering for nano-electro-mechanical system", "A nano-electro-mechanical system (NEMS) that integrates various nano-scale mechanical sensors onto a single chip, has attracted exceptional interest among research and engineering communities. Among other remarkable characteristics, these tiny mechanical structures possess strong nonlinear properties. Typically, device nonlinearity is intentionally avoided, because higher amplitude fluctuations in the nonlinear region could be translated into frequency variability. Recently, we found that nonlinearity bifurcation could be used to stabilize our membrane oscillator with nanowire (NW) arrays. As a consequence, we propose to use our NEMS device as a platform to investigate its nonlinear dynamics and gain a deeper understanding of the origins of that nonlinearity. This could present a general mechanism to assist oscillation frequency stabilization and improve NEMS resonator performance for bio-molecular sensing applications. These nanowire arrays could also be embedded into suspended micro-channels. Coupled with the nonlinearity-assisted frequency stabilization result, the sensitivity of the mass sensor could be improved by orders of magnitude.", "Recommended references:", "3. Nano-electro-mechanical system based on novel two dimensional nano-materials", "Two-dimensional (2D) nano-materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and graphene, have atomic or molecular thickness, exhibiting promising applications in nano-electro-mechanical systems. Graphene is a one-atom thick carbon sheet, with atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) belongs to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) semiconductor family YX2 (Y=Mo, W; X=S, Se, Te), with a layered structure. These 2D nano-materials can be integrated into nano-electro-mechanical systems, enabling ultra-sensitive mechanical mass sensors, with single molecule or even single atom sensitivities. Moreover, the mechanical resonators based on these 2D nano-materials would be a perfect platform to investigate quantum mechanics, opto-mechanics, material internal friction force, nonlinear physics, etc.", "Recommended references:", "4. High-throughput Nano-manufacturing", "Nanolithography is important for nano-scale device fabrication, both in academia and in the semiconductor industry. The fundamental challenge in developing nanolithography systems is to create a system with high resolution (sub-20 nm), high throughput (4-inch wafer exposure within 30 seconds), high controllability and low cost. I have demonstrated the proof of concept for a new lithography system --- Radioisotope-powered Parallel Electron Lithography (RIPEL). This system uses high energy electrons emitted from radioisotope thin films to expose resist through a stencil mask. The RIPEL system simultaneously exposes the entire substrate, making it a parallel system, as opposed to the serial raster scanning electron beam lithography system. This will enable the rapid exposure of nano-scale features over very large substrates. However, there are still several significant hurdles in preventing RIPEL\u2019s practical uses. We will study these hurdles and propose developing building blocks to overcome these hurdles, through radioisotope electron sources development, new mask design, and investigation of new electron resist. These building blocks will enhance RIPEL\u2019s throughput by four orders of magnitude. The progress will significantly benefit the areas that need volumetric nanostructures with high spatial density and good controllability, such as plasmonics, nanoelectronics, micro/nano-electro-mechanical systems, nano-structured thin film solar cells, biomedical devices, etc.", "Recommended references:", "5. High-efficiency nano-structured thin film solar cells", "Nanostructured silicon thin film solar cells are promising, due to the strongly enhanced light trapping, high carrier collection efficiency, and potential low cost. Ordered nanostructure arrays, with large-area controllable spacing, orientation, and size, are critical for reliable light-trapping and high-efficiency solar cells. Available top-down lithography approaches to fabricate large-area ordered nanostructure arrays are challenging due to the requirement of both high lithography resolution and high throughput. Here, a novel ordered silicon nano-conical-frustum array structure, exhibiting an impressive absorbance over broad band wavelengths by a thickness of only 5 \u03bcm, is realized by our recently reported technique radioisotope-powered parallel electron lithography. Moreover, high-efficiency (up to 10.8%) solar cells are demonstrated, using these ordered ultrathin silicon nano-conical-frustum arrays.", "Although these nano-structure arrays have high light absorption efficiency, the solar cell efficiency is still less than half of that for bulk crystalline Si solar cells and the open circuit voltage and fill factor are lower too. This is probably due to the high surface recombination losses, which are introduced by the highly enhanced surface area from the nanostructures, although a thin passivation oxide layer was used. Therefore, how to reduce the surface loss through appropriate surface passivation is critical to further enhance the conversion efficiency. In addition, it will be also interesting to transfer the related fabrication techniques to low-cost substrate.", "Recommended references:", "6. High-efficiency betavoltaic cells by novel semiconductor nano-materials", "Betavoltaics are generators that convert energy from a radioactive beta source to electricity. A beta radioisotope atom gives off a beta high energy particle (e.g., electron) through beta decay, which is governed by Poisson statistics emission event. Radioactive decay is independent of temperature and pressure. Only near nuclear fusion temperatures can the fundamental decay processes be modified. Furthermore the half-lives of many radioisotopes are several years to decades to even centuries. When the high energy beta particles traverse a semiconductor, electron-hole pairs are produced and separated by the built in electrical field of the pn junction, leading to energy conversion. Betavoltaic power sources have very promising applications in harsh environments where long life of the energy source is required. Novel semiconductor nano-materials, such as porous silicon, GaN nano-crystals, etc, have great potential to realize high efficiency betavoltaic cells.", "Recommended references:"], "publication": [{"title": "Preface for a special issue on 2D materials: Growth", "year": "2017", "source": "characterisationproperties and devices", "authors": ["Lee C", "Sundharam R", "Jaiswal M eds", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Enhanced second-harmonic generation from two-dimensional MoSe2 by waveguide integration", "year": "2017", "source": "2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, CLEO 2017, IEEE, New York, pp. 1-2", "authors": ["Chen H", "Corboliou V", "Solntsev A", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Enhanced second-harmonic generation from two-dimensional MoSe2 on a silicon waveguide", "year": "2017", "source": "Light: Science & Applications, vol. 6, no. 10, pp. 1-7", "authors": ["Chen H", "Corboliou V", "Solntsev A", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Elastic and Inelastic Light-Matter Interactions in 2D Materials", "year": "2017", "source": "IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, vol. 23, no. 1, pp. -", "authors": ["Pei J", "Yang J", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Phosphorene: An emerging 2D material", "year": "2017", "source": "Journal of Materials Research, vol. 32, no. 15, pp. 2839-2847", "authors": ["Yang J", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Optical properties of phosphorene", "year": "2017", "source": "Chinese Physics B, vol. 26, no. 3, pp. 9pp", "authors": ["Yang J", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Oxygen plasma produced stable few-layer phosphorene in the air", "year": "2016", "source": "Australian Conference on Optical Fibre Technology (ACOFT 2016), Optical Society of American (OSA), New York, USA, pp. -", "authors": ["Gai X", "Pei J", "Yang J", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "tomically thin lateral p-n junction photodetector with large effective detection area", "year": "2016", "source": "2D Materials, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 9pp", "authors": ["Xu Z", "Zhang Y", "Wang Z", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Molecule-Induced Conformational Change in Boron Nitride Nanosheets with Enhanced Surface Adsorption", "year": "2016", "source": "Advanced Functional Materials, vol. 26, no. 45, pp. 8202-8210", "authors": ["Cai Q", "Du A", "Gao G", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Light-Matter Interactions in Phosphorene", "year": "2016", "source": "Accounts of Chemical Research, vol. 49, no. 9, pp. 1806-1815", "authors": ["Junpeng L", "Yang J", "Carvalho A", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Producing air-stable monolayers of phosphorene and their defect engineering", "year": "2016", "source": "Nature Communications, vol. 7, no. 10450, pp. 10450-10450", "authors": ["Pei J", "Gai X", "Yang J", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Layer-dependent surface potential of phosphorene and anisotropic/layer-dependent charge transfer in phosphorene-gold hybrid systems", "year": "2016", "source": "Nanoscale, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 129-135pp", "authors": ["Xu R", "Yang J", "Zhu Y", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Exciton Brightening in Monolayer Phosphorene via Dimensionality Modification", "year": "2016", "source": "Advanced Materials, vol. 28, no. 18, pp. 3493-3498pp", "authors": ["Xu R", "Yang J", "Win Myint Y", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Strongly enhanced photoluminescence in nanostructured monolayer MoS2 by chemical vapor deposition", "year": "2016", "source": "Nanotechnology, vol. 27, no. 13, pp. 7pp", "authors": ["Zhu Y", "Yang J", "Zhang S", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Two-Dimensional CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3) Perovskite: Synthesis and Optoelectronic Application", "year": "2016", "source": "ACS Nano, vol. 10, no. 3, pp. 3536-3542", "authors": ["Lin J", "Xue Y", "Wang Z", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Manipulation of photoluminescence of two-dimensional MoSe2 by gold nanoantennas", "year": "2016", "source": "Scientific Reports, vol. 6, pp. 22296-22296", "authors": ["Chen H", "Yang J", "Rusak E", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "Robust Excitons and Trions in Monolayer MoTe2", "year": "2015", "source": "ACS Nano, vol. 9, no. 6, pp. 6603-6609", "authors": ["Yang J", "Yuerui Lu", "Win Myint Y"]}, {"title": "Electronic applications of graphene mechanical resonators", "year": "2015", "source": "IET Circuits, Devices and Systems, vol. 9, no. 6, pp. 413-419", "authors": ["Sharma A", "Varshney U", "Yuerui Lu"]}, {"title": "D materials for nanophotonic devices", "year": "2015", "source": "SPIE Micro+Nano Materials, Devices, and Applications Symposium 2015, ed.
