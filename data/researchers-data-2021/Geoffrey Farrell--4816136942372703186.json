This is a major problem during liver surgery and is also an underlying problem in liver transplantation; following storage of a donor liver ready for placing into the recipient it can undergo a similar process called preservation injury. We now understand a lot about how IR comes about, particularly by the formation of damaging oxygen radicals within liver cells to start a process of programmed cell death, but it remains difficult to prevent or treat IR injury. A recent breakthrough has been recognition that subjecting the liver to only a short period (5 or 10 minutes) of ischemia protects against a later period of prolonged ischemia or IR. In the investigator s mouse model, for example, such preconditioning was 60 to 90% protective (depending on the time after IR). This project seeks to understand how preconditioning works to protect the liver against IR injury. Our idea is that preconditioning generates a limited amount of oxygen radicals, and that these turn on signalling pathways in the cell that regulate certain protective genes. Genes that encode antioxidant and other anti-stress pathways are likely to be important, but so are genes that prepare the cell to enter the cell cycle and divide into new cells that regenerate the liver. Conversely, genes that program cell death may be turned off. The outcomes of this research will be to understand the molecular and cellular basis of how preconditioning protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury of the liver. This will allow drug treatments to be devised that, by simulating preconditioning, prevent this common and severe type of liver damage.", "title": "Preconditioning: the molecular basis for protection from hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury", "id": "97222", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211137", "researchers": ["Prof Geoffrey Farrell"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 406980, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:38Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T06:45:01Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Sydney"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Geoffrey Farrell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211137", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/211137", "211137"], "subjects": ["321029", "Cell biology", "Hepatic ischaemia reperfusion injury", "Preconditioning", "Receptor signalling pathways", "Tumor necrosis factor", "Alcoholic liver disease", "Liver failure", "Liver surgery", "Liver transplantation", "Shock and cardiac failure"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97222"}]}, {"description": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs in overweight people, diabetes and with high blood pressure and raised cholesterol.

Hence patients with alcohol-induced liver disease have a high mortality and prolonged hospital stays. The applicants have been supported by NHMRC to study how alcohol impairs liver regeneration. They found that the effect is at the level of cell surface receptors for the growth factors that control liver regeneration. Alcohol alters the function of these receptors. One major discovery has been that it damages the capacity to generate a rise in calcium within the cell, something that is fundamentally required for any cell to divide and reproduce itself. Thus when a rise in calcium was produced artificially (with chemicals to unlock the internal calcium stores), liver cells from alcohol-fed rats once more responded normally under the influence of growth factors and replicated themselves. The present work isdesigned to find out where this effect of calcium is exerted. The investigators believe that it is related to how other types of signals work, the so-called protein kinase pathways. These are cascades of one protein turning on (activating) the next down the line to ultimately switch on the genes that control cell growth. They will manipulate liver cells from alcohol-fed rats in culture to establish which of these pathways is most affected, and which is the most critical for the control of cell division genes. These studies will greatly advance our understanding about how alcohol impairs liver regeneration. They will give new insight into the control of liver cell growth and division that is such a crucial response of the liver to injury, vital for survival of the liver. This kind of knowledge will open the door for new treatments to be designed that can control liver growth - turn it back on when it has been poisoned, or turn it off when it is inappropriately vigorous and predisposing to liver cancer.", "title": "ALCOHOL AND IMPAIRED LIVER REGENERATION: EFFECTS ON MITOGENIC SIGNALING PATHWAYS", "id": "77702", "institutions": ["University of Sydney"],
