From 2002 to 2003 I worked part-time as Director of the Genetic Epidemiology Unit at the Menzies Institute of Population Health Research at the University of Tasmania and from 2004 to 2005 worked as one of the foundation Trusted Intermediaries in the InnovationXchange Network. From 2008 to 2011 I was appointed as Deputy Director, JCSMR.I have received over $22,000,000 in external research funding to support his research from a wide range of agencies including the Australian Research Council and The National Health and Medical Research Council. I have published 2 books and ~175 articles and I have been invited to give numerous international seminar and conference presentations.I have supervised 25 PhD students and has been an advisor to many more, and 12 masters-by-research and honours students.From 1998 to 2003 I was Editor-in-Chief of Molecular Biology and  Evolution and I have served on the Editorial Boards of a number of other journals. I was a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Entigen Inc. (a bioinformatics start-up company based in Sunnyvale, California; 2001), the Scientific Advisory Committee of Genetic Technologies Ltd. (a Melbourne-based genetics testing company; 2003-07), the Research Committee of the Australian Institute of Sport (2001-03), the Selection Advisory Committee of the Australian Research Council Future Fellowships Scheme (2010), the National Selection Committee of the Australian-American Fulbright Commission (2009-10) and the ARC Bioinformatics Centre of Excellence, University of Queensland (2003-10). I have been a consultant to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), The Australian Industry Group, the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and the University of Tasmania. I have provided expert testimony in relation to DNA evidence in the ACT, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, and I have provided expert advice to a wide range of organisations and agencies.", "project": ["Gene-environment interactions affecting mental health and cognitive decline in late age.", "Gene-environment interactions in human social and affiliative behaviour.", "Genetics and evolution of human psychological diveristy.", "Genomic responses to environmental change in humans.", "Human genome diversity and evolution."], "publication": [{"title": "Collaborative meta-Analysis finds no evidence of a strong interaction between stress and 5-HTTLPR genotype contributing to the development of depression", "year": "2018", "source": "Molecular Psychiatry, vol. 23, no. 1, pp. 133-142pp", "authors": ["Culverhouse R", "Saccone N", "Horton A", "Simon Easteal"]}, {"title": "Rare DNA variants in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene increase risk for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a next-generation sequencing study", "year": "2017", "source": "Molecular Psychiatry, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 580-584", "authors": ["Hawi Z", "Cummins T", "Tong J", "Simon Easteal"]}, {"title": "The dynamic upper limit of human lifespan", "year": "2017", "source": "F1000 Research, vol. 6, no. 569, pp. 12pp", "authors": ["Newman S", "Simon Easteal"]}, {"title": "The dynamic upper limit of human lifespan [version 2; referees: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]", "year": "2017", "source": "F1000 Research, vol. 6, no. 569, pp. 20pp", "authors": ["Newman S", "Simon Easteal"]}, {"title": "ssociation of AKAP6 and MIR2113 with cognitive performance in a population based sample of older adults", "year": "2017", "source": "Genes, Brain and Behavior, vol. 16, no. 4, pp. 472-478pp", "authors": ["Andrews S", "Das D", "Anstey K", "Simon Easteal"]}, {"title": "Molecular Psychiatry", "year": "2017", "source": "Molecular Psychiatry, vol.

These disorders span the entire spectrum of diseases that have a genetic component, such as autoimmune diseases and cancers, therefore influencing all age groups. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process is a priority since it is the essential knowledge required for understanding all of the factors that contribute to this array of debilitating diseases, and for devising effective preventative and diagnostic measures. To attain this understanding necessitates establishing the mechanistic origins of germline mutagenesis. Two basic approaches are employed to understand this process. The first assesses the incidence of mutation in pedigrees. This identifies the spectrum of risk mutations underlying the specific disease surveyed. Because other biological processes also influence these observations, the results from this approach do not reflect the underlying germline mutation spectra and are therefore not translatable between diseases. As mutations are rare events, it is prohibitive to obtain sufficient observations to resolve the underlying mechanisms. The second approach employs comparative genomic data, and uses differences in germline biology to estimate sex-biased effects. This comparative approach benefits from the accumulation of mutations over vast periods of time. The approach has not, however, been applied to diagnose the mechanistic origins of mutations. In this project, we will apply the enormous volume of comparative sequencing data to relate components of the mutagenic spectrum with sexual differences in germline biology. The project will differentiate between different types of mutations, and their association with specific processes will be established. The results will be a determination of the relative contributions of different mechanisms of mutation to germline mutagenesis.", "title": "Exploiting sexual differences in germline biology to resolve the causes of germline mutation", "id": "96440", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366739", "researchers": ["Prof Simon Easteal", "Prof Gavin Huttley"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 315914.3, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-04-12T07:51:52Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:57:30Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Gavin Huttley"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366739", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/366739", "366739"], "subjects": ["Molecular Evolution", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "GENETICS", "Bioinformatics", "DNA methylation", "Germline mutation", "Phylogeny based maximum-likelihood", "Sex biased germline mutation", "Age associated mutation risk", "Factors causing germline mutation", "Inherited disorders", "Mutation risk assessment"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96440"}]}, {"description": "The project aims to investigate how the arginine vasopressin 1a gene affects gene expression and influences social behaviour and ultimately health and wellbeing.

It is also a study of normal cognitive development, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. PATH involves three cohorts of adults who were aged 20-24, 40-44 and 60-64 at baseline. They are followed up at four yearly intervals. This application seeks funding for Wave 3 of the study, which will allow for 8 years of follow-up of the baseline sample to be conducted. The key aims are to discover the relationships between biological and psychological processes in depression, anxiety, substance abuse and cognitive ageing; to identify the socio-demographic factors contributing to these disorders, and to quantify more fully the range of social and economic consequences of mental illness and cognitive decline. Such consequences include reduced workforce participation, relationship breakdown, family and carer burden, suicide attempts, use of health services and need for social welfare. Wave 3 will also focus on transitions into parenthood, fertility and mental health, menopause, and retirement. Factors in early and mid-adulthood that influence healthy ageing and cognitive decline in late life will be identified. Information is obtained on physical health, health habits , social networks, employment and work stress, lifestyle activities, personality, family structure, physical function and cognitive performance. DNA has also been obtained and a sub-sample of the oldest cohort also participate in a study of brain MRIs. Longitudinal analysis is the only means of distinguishing the causes of disorders and tracking their development within individuals.
