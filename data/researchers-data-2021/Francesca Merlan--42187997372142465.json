This research association also continues, and has developed into contacts with other European locations and institutions (in Spain, Italy and France) concerning questions of agrarian transition, social change and conflicts over homely belonging in various locations (including, most recently, ones of intensive tourist visitation). I remain committed to ethnographic fieldwork in these areas.", "project": ["I have done research over many years in Northern Australia, where I have been interested in changes in the lives of Aboriginal people who have moved into regional towns (Merlan 1998), in their relations with the areas from which they originate, and in their new circumstances.\u00a0 Over the time I have done research in the north, and given the emphasis on land claims and native title, I have been involved in these processes, by which the state has sought to regulate and restore indigenous associations with land. It has been one of the bases of my theoretical interest in socio-cultural transformation and attempts to model and understand it.", "I have done research in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea (Merlan and Rumsey 1991), where the lives of people have clearly changed under outside influence, but where relations to land largely remain outside the sphere of state regulation and the land itself under indigenous tenure. Here research emphases have been on the continuing vitality of (but also change in) segmentary sociality and politics, periodic warfare which has occurred in the Nebilyer Valley and region, and Western Highlanders' own interest in change and market participation.", "My field research in southern Germany has been in a region of Bavaria where farming remains very important, ideologically and as livelihood, and where many see themselves as having deep-rooted relations of indigeneity to specific local areas and villages; nevertheless, the long-term process of exit from agrarian occupation has continued apace. I have attempted to describe how people see and deal with this, and to document and analyse the ways in which people here attempt to limit the effects of change (Merlan 2004, 2010). This of course has required engagement with an historically and culturally complex set of issues in relation to the wider German, European and global settings.", "I have plans to collaborate on research in Venice on various aspects of the current situation there including: concerning on the part of `real Venetians' with the overwhelming tourist visitation and economy; the simultaneous partipation of Venetians and others in that economy; questions around belonging and regulation in an environment of this intensive touristic kind, and around homely and family belonging in Venice."], "publication": [{"title": "Ku Waru Clause Chaining and the Acquisition of Complex Syntax", "year": "2020", "source": "Frontiers in Communication, vol. 5, no. 19, pp. 1-30", "authors": ["Rumsey A", "Reed L", "Francesca Merlan"]}, {"title": "Obituary: James F.
