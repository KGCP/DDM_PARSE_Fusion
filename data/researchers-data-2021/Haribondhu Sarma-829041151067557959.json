I am also affiliated with the Centre for Mental Health Research at the ANU and am supporting impact analysis of digital mental health implementations. My research has strongly contributed to implementation science, providing a comprehensive, conceptual framework for scaling-up innovative health interventions in a real-world setting. Earlier, I was affiliated with icddr,b, a reputed international health research institute. At icddr,b, I led multiple research projects on infectious disease, nutrition, vaccination, HIV/AIDS and chronic diseases, publishing more than 70 papers, including peer-reviewed publications, book chapters and research reports. As a principal investigator, I have awarded nine research grants, totalling approximately US $2 million. I have developed networks among several international funding agencies, research institutes, UN bodies and global alliances, including the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation (UK), the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) (Switzerland), Gavi\u2013The Vaccine Alliance (Switzerland), Harvard T.H.
