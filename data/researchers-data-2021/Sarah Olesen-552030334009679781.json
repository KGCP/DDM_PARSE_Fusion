Her current and planned research aims to better understand people's use of health services in Australia, and the health outcomes of service use, particularly in the area of mental health. Dr Olesen is also involved in projects that investigate the relationships between community and workforce participation and mental health.Dr Olesen uses large community and population surveys and epidemiological methods to address these research topics, as well as her knowledge of clinical and psychological models. By combining these perspectives, Dr Olesen seeks to produce research that provides informed, practical recommendations for policy and health-care settings."], "biography": "Dr Olesen completed a Bachelor of Arts (Psychology/Criminology) with Honours degree at the University of Melbourne in 2003 before beginning a career in mental health research at The Australian National University. Since 2004 she has undertaken research projects on the topics of workforce and community participation, childhood adversity, and health service use, leading to published work in qualtiy academic journals. This included a PhD entitled: \u201cThe transition from work to retirement during later adulthood: Its relationship to mental health and role of alternative forms of participation\u201d. Dr Olesen has completed specialised training in longitudinal data analyses and health program evaluation, and contributed to documents and forums that aim to translate research findings into policy and practice recommendations. She continues to undertake research that tackles current public health issues using methods that maximise the ability of this research to inform mental health service delivery.", "project": ["Dr Olesen's research uses several community and epidemiological surveys to investigate the relationships between personal characteristics, service use, and environmental factors and changes in  mental health.
