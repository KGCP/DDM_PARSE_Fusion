Much of this work focuses on patterns, mechanisms and prospective influence of adverse early life exposures and stressors, including discrimination, stigma and bias.She is also interested in socialisation processes among children from stigmatised and non-stigmatised groups, including development of racial/ethnic attitudes, bias, stereotypes and prejudice.A third area of her research is focused on initiatives to counter stigma, discrimination and bias and promote diversity and inclusion among individuals, organisations and across society."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "Education inequalities in adult all-cause mortality: first national data for Australia using linked census and mortality data.
