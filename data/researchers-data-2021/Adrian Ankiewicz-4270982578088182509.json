Such progress is a necessity for our ability to predict their appearance in the ocean or their use in optics. This project will enhance the modelling of extreme waves by taking into account higher order effects such as third order dispersion, self-steepening and time delayed response, as well as dissipative and higher order nonlinear terms. These are essential for a precise description of both giant waves in the ocean and strong pulses in optics.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP140100265", "id": "518128", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100265", "researchers": ["Dr Adrian Ankiewicz", "Prof Dr Nail Akhmediev"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 360000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2014, "endDate": 2016, "dateTimeModified": "2016-05-29T08:50:31Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2015-04-12T05:07:22Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100265", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP140100265", "DP140100265"], "subjects": ["APPLIED MATHEMATICS", "MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES", "extreme events", "rogue waves", "solitons"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/518128"}]}]}
