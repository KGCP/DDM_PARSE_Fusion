Later on, he joined as a Lecturer at KUET in 2012 and upgraded his position into Assistant Professor in 2014. He started PhD in the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS) at the Australian National University (ANU) in 2015 and was conferred the degree on 19 July 2019. He has been working as a tutor with ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) and as a Research Assistant with RSCS and ANU College of Business and Economics. He was also a casual tutor for the Faculty of Science and Technology at University of Canberra. He completed his first postdoc\u00a0with RSCS and Our Health in Our\u00a0Hands (OHIOH) project at ANU. He also worked for short-term Postdoc with the Cetre for Health Informatics at Macquarie University, North Ryde, Sydney. Currently, Dr Zakir is a Research Fellow at Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI), ANU and CSIRO, Canberra. He is also a honorary leturer for RSCS, ANU.", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "rtificial Neural Networks Can Distinguish Genuine and Acted Anger by Synthesizing Pupillary Dilation Signals from Different Participants", "year": "2018", "source": "25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing, ICONIP 2018, ed.
