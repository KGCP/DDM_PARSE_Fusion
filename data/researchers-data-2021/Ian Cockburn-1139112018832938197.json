It has long been known that immunization with irradiated parasites (which do not cause infection) can induce sterile immunity against live parasites injected by infected mosquitoes. A large part of this vaccine-like protection is mediated by CD8+ T cells which can kill parasite infected hepatocytes in the liver. My research addresses a number of critical questions about how protective T cell responses work.\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do irradiated parasites induce such an effective CD8+ T cell response?\u00a0Prior to immunization, irradiated parasites have to be dissected out of infected mosquitoes \u2013 this probably makes them an unfeasible real-world vaccine. However by learning how parasites can induce protective CD8+ T cells we can learn what features a vaccine should have. We have discovered that irradiated parasites induce the immune system to retain antigen for a period of up to two months. In this time the persisting\u00a0Plasmodium\u00a0antigens can continually stimulate and help the expansion of malaria specific CD8+ T cells and thus maximize the immune response.\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What molecules are the targets of malaria-protective immune responses?The malaria parasite has around 5000 genes, which means many molecules could potentially be targets of the immune response. However not all proteins will be presented to CD8+ T cells \u2013 a process that is required to initiate an immune response. A critical question is then is \u201chow does the immune system acquire and process antigens from malaria parasites?\u201d Using a novel transgenic system to track antigen presentation we have found that the critical targets of protective immunity (i.e. potential vaccine candidates) are those molecules secreted out of the parasite and into the cytosol of the infected hepatocyte. These proteins can then be processed and presented to CD8+ T cells by the host cell. A critical area for future work will be determining which molecules are secreted and why.\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0 How do effector CD8+ T cells find and eliminate infected hepatocytes?\u00a0As an infected mosquito usually injects fewer that 100 parasites, the proportion of infected cells in the liver is tiny. Nonetheless CD8+ T cells are capable of finding these parasites and killing them before they have a chance to initiate a clinical infection. We would like to know how this process works. In collaboration with colleagues at the Instiut Pasteur (Paris, France) we are developing intra-vital imaging techniques to track the behaviour of T cells in the infected liver and understand the events surrounding parasite elimination by CD8+ T cells."], "biography": "", "project": [], "publication": [{"title": "HIV Immunogens: Affinity Is Key", "year": "2018", "source": "Immunity, vol. 48, no. 1, pp. 11-13pp", "authors": ["Prabhu S", "Ian Cockburn", "Garcia de Vinuesa C"]}, {"title": "Malaria prevention: from immunological concepts to effective vaccines and protective antibodies", "year": "2018", "source": "Nature Immunology, vol. 19, pp. 1199-1211pp", "authors": ["Ian Cockburn", "Seder R"]}, {"title": "Flexible polygon-mirror based laser scanning microscope platform for multiphoton in-vivo imaging", "year": "2017", "source": "Journal of Biophotonics, vol. 10, no. 11, pp. 1526-1537", "authors": ["Li Y", "Gautam V", "Bruestle A", "Ian Cockburn"]}, {"title": "TFH-derived dopamine accelerates productive synapses in germinal centres", "year": "2017", "source": "Nature, vol. 547, no. 7663, pp. 318+", "authors": ["Papa I", "Saliba D", "Ponzoni M", "Ian Cockburn"]}, {"title": "T-dependent B cell responses to Plasmodium induce antibodies that form a high-avidity multivalent complex with the circumsporozoite protein", "year": "2017", "source": "PLoS Pathogens, vol. 13, no. 7, pp. 23pp", "authors": ["Fisher C", "Sutton H", "Kaczmarski J", "Ian Cockburn"]}, {"title": "Embracing diversity gives antibodies the power to bind", "year": "2017", "source": "Immunology and Cell Biology, vol. 95, no. 10, pp. 862-863pp", "authors": ["Sutton H", "Ian Cockburn"]}, {"title": "Cationic amino acid transporters play key roles in the survival and transmission of apicomplexan parasites", "year": "2017", "source": "Nature Communications, 8:14455. doi: 10.1038/ncomms14455", "authors": ["Rajendran E", "Hapuarachchi S", "Miller C", "Ian Cockburn"]}, {"title": "High speed multiphoton imaging", "year": "2016", "source": "SPIE Biophotonics Australasia, ed.
