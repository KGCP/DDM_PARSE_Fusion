Deficit discourse frames Indigenous identity in a narrative of negativity and deficiency.

By mapping the discursive environment and analysing education programs that reject the deficit model, this project assesses whether its removal improves outcomes for Indigenous students. This project provides an original approach to challenge entrenched perceptions, resulting in tangible benefits for the Australian education system and the communities that it serves.", "title": "Discovery Indigenous - Grant ID: IN150100007", "id": "618456", "institutions": ["Australian National University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/IN150100007", "researchers": ["Prof Michael Dodson", "Mr Scott Gorringe", "Dr William Fogarty", "A/Prof Kerry McCallum", "A/Prof Patrick Sullivan", "Dr Lisa Waller", "A/Prof Cressida Fforde"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 456000, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Indigenous", "startDate": 2015, "endDate": 2017, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-05T03:02:08Z", "dateTimeCreated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Australian National University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/IN150100007", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/IN150100007", "IN150100007"], "subjects": ["SPECIALIST STUDIES IN EDUCATION", "EDUCATION", "DEFICIT DISCOURSE; INDIGENOUS EDUCATION; INDIGENOUS IDENTITY"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/618456"}]}]}
