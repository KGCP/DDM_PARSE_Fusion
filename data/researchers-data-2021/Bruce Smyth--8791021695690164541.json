of home for children in separated families by interviewing children and parents about children&rsquo;s experiences of home and homemaking. Since most children now traverse two households, there needs to be an increasing emphasis in policy, law and professional practice on listening to children regarding their post-separation living arrangements. By describing and analysing home for children, the project will provide a solid basis for shifting the prevailing focus on parents&rsquo; needs in application of the law toward more child-responsive parenting arrangements. This new knowledge will support parents and professionals to achieve child-responsive approaches to post-separation parenting arrangements, reducing potentially adverse impacts of parental separation on children, and benefitting children, families and the community.", "title": "Discovery Projects - Grant ID: DP180102799", "id": "1316719", "institutions": ["University of Melbourne"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102799", "researchers": ["Prof Belinda Fehlberg", "A/Prof Kristin Natalier", "A/Prof Bruce Smyth"], "subject_type": null, "subject_value_resolved": null, "status": "active", "fundingAmount": 250846, "fundingScheme": "Discovery Projects", "startDate": 2018, "endDate": 2023, "dateTimeModified": "2019-06-03T03:28:42Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2018-03-06T23:37:35Z", "funder": ["Australian Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["University of Melbourne"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102799", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP180102799", "DP180102799"], "subjects": null, "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/1316719"}]}]}
