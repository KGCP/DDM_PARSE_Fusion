severely debilitating mental health problem affecting between 0.5 and 1% of the population at any point in time. Children with OCD frequently experience high functional impairment as a result of their symptoms, including deteriorating school performance and poor peer relationships. Family life is often disrupted, causing significant distress and hardship to parents and siblings. However, little research attention has been paid to how families affect and are affected by this disabling condition. This research examines the role of learning in the development, maintenance and treatment of OCD. Specifically, the study aims to: 1. explore the way in which children with OCD process threatening information 2. investigate the influence of parents on children's processing of OCD-relevant information 3. develop and implement the world's first randomised control trial of cognitive-behavioural plus parent training (CBT + PT) for childhood OCD 4. evaluate parent-assisted treatment in comparison to a standard cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) and a placebo control 5. examine the long-term maintenance of each type of treatment The outcomes of this project will be: 1. an improved understanding of OCD in children, and their families 2. an increased knowledge of the relationship between parenting processes and OCD symptomatology 3. the development and dissemination of an evidence-based treatment for childhood OCD", "title": "The Role of Learning in the Development, Maintenance, and Treatment of Paediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "id": "95566", "institutions": ["Griffith University"], "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/123102", "researchers": ["Prof Paula Barrett"], "status": "closed", "fundingAmount": 189604.11, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2001, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-10T03:55:02Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T05:56:53Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council"], "managingInstitution": ["Griffith University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Paula Barrett"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/123102", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/123102", "123102"], "subjects": ["321204", "Children and Youth", "Cognitive Processes", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Parental Processes", "Treatment", "Psychopathology"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95566"}]}, {"description": "Anxiety and depression are the most common forms of psychological distress affecting Australian children today. These disorders are seriously disabling and continuous across time. Therefore, it is very important to understand more about the onset and course of these disorders, and about factors which influence these disorders in either a positive or negative manner. There are three major goals for the current project. The first is to further our understanding of the development, maintenance, and amelioration of anxiety and depression in a child and youth population. The second is to understand the relationship between these two disorders in children and youth. The third is to use the acquired information to assist in the identification of optimal ages for preventive interventions, and to aid in the matching of interventions to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of children versus adolescents. This project aims to meet these goals through implementation of a controlled prevention trial. The aims fo the research are: 1. To examine the relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depresison in Australian children and youth 2. To gain valuable clinical information regarding the assessment and prevention of these disorders 3. To understand the risk and protective factors associated with these disorders, and the impact of these factors over time 4. To implement and evaluate a school-based prevention program The expected outcomes of the research are: 1. To acquire valuable information related to the onset and course of anxiety and depression in children and youth, and their associated risk and protective factors 2. To further development of more timely and targeted interventions for the prevention of anxiety and depression 4. To enhance the emotional resilience of participating children and prevent the onset of anxiety and depression 5.
